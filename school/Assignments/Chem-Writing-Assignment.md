  I liked chapter 2 because of how fundamental a lot of the stuff in that chapter was. Much of it, especially surrounding electromagnetic radiation, is something we use every day and don't even think about it. This is really cool to learn about because it lets me view something I use every day as something phenomenal. I also am a computer engineering major, so the electron and surrounding focuses fascinate me. While it isn't applied in something like circuits it is still incredible to learn the fundamentals of that, which is the fundamentals of everything, as it is a key component of the atom.
  This chapter also covered a lot about how quantum mechanics works and while it was just a introductory covering of it, it was still very enlightening to see how we view atoms in the modern sense, as all of the other classes I have taken taught in a classical sense. The history of discovery in this chapter was also cool, as a lot of the discoveries happened within the last century or so. It was cool learning how light works and puts it in a different view to how I see things like "neon" signs and other light emitting objects.
