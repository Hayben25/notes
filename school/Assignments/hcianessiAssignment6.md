## Problem 1
- The electrons are going from left to right because electrons move from - to + or towards higher potential. That direction is left to right because v$_b$ is negative.

| Device | Current | Voltage | Sign Convention |
| ------ | ------- | ------- | --------------- |
| A      | 1.5     | 15      | Passive         |
| B      | 1.5     | 5       | Active          |
| C      | 0.5     | 10      | Passive         |
| D      | 2       | 20      | Active          |
| E      | 2       | 10      | Passive         |

| Device | Power | Absorbs/Delivers |
| ------ | ----- | ---------------- |
| A      | 22.5  | Absorbed         |
| B      | 7.5   | Delivered        |
| C      | 5     | Absorbed         |
| D      | 40    | Delivered        |
| E      | 20    | Absorbed         |
- Power is conserved because Power absorbed = Power Delivered because $22.5\ W+5\ W+20\ W=7.5\ W+40\ W=47.5\ W$
