Lift

- Airfoil  
  - Any surface that provides aerodynamic force when it interacts with a moving stream of air  
- Bernoulli’s Principle  
  - Velocity and pressure are inversely proportional  
- Angle of Attack  
  - Difference between chord line and relative wind  
- Pilot Control of lift  
  - Changing angle of attack (AOA)  
  - Changing airspeed  
  - Both combined  
    - As speed decreases, AOA must increase to maintain lift  
- Weight  
  - Force of gravity due to the earth  
- Thrust   
  - Forward acting force that opposes drag  
  - Caused by propeller \- which is a rotating airfoil  
  - In straight and level, unaccelerated flight all forces are equal  
  - Adding power, or thrust, increases thrust and airspeed  
- Drag  
  - 2 Types:  
    - Parasite drag  
      - Form  
        - Shape of plane  
      - Skin Friction  
        - Molecules are rough  
      - Interference  
        - Fuseloge and wing drag combining  
    - Induced drag  
      - Created by circulation of air around the wing  
      - Byproduct of lift as high-pressure areas attempt to reach low-pressure areas   
      - Major cause of drag at low air speeds  
      - Causes adverse yaw  
    - Ground effect  
      - Associated with the reduction of induced drag near the ground  
      - Feels like a cushion

| Primary Control Surface | Airplane Movement | Axes of Rotation | Type of Stability |

| Elevator/Stabilator | Pitch | Lateral | Longitudinal |
| Rudder | Yaw | Vertical | Directional |

Stability

- Recoverability of the plane  
- 2 Types:  
  - Static \- aircrafts’ initial tendency back to equilibrium  
    - Positive  
    - Neutral  
    - Negative  
  - Dynamic- Aircraft response over time when disturbed from given pitch, yaw, or bank  
    - Positive  
    - Neutral  
    - Negative  
  - Maneuverability & Controlability  
    - Responsiveness  
  - Longitudinal Stability  
    - Involves the pitching motion or tendency of the aircraft to move about its lateral axis  
    - Location of CG is important

Center of gravity

| Forward CG | Aft CG |
| :---- | :---- |
| More stable (longitudinal stability)  | Less stable (longitudinal stability) |
| Less fuel efficient (more drag) | More fuel efficient (less drag) |
| Higher stall speed (higher AOA) | Lower stall speed (lower AOA) |
| Good stall recovery characteristics  | Bad stall recovery characteristics |

- Lateral Stability  
  - Stability about an aircraft’s longitudinal axis  
  - 4 main aircraft design factors to help:  
    - Dihedral  
      - When a gust causes a roll, a slideslip will occur  
      - The difference of lift caused by a difference in AOA will create a corrective rolling moment  
    - Sweepback  
      - Similar to dihedral but uses yaw  
      - Newton’s 3rd law and other shenanigans  
    - Keel Effect and weight distribution  
      - Keel effect is like a pendulum when one wing dips it will oscillate and return to straight  
  - Directional Stability  
    - Vertical tail is integral to directional stability  
      - Wethervane  
      - rudder is harder to use with more aft CoG  
  - Stalls  
    - Happens when you exceed the critical AOA  
    - Stall speed varies  
    - Stall AOA is always the same for particular aircraft  
    - Lose enough lift to lose altitude (weight \> stalled lift)  
    - Regain control:  
      - Reduce AOA  
      - Max power  
      - Wings level (level ailerons)  
      - Let airspeed build, and climb once a positive rate has been established   
        - Positive rate means your VSI is indicated a rate \> 0  
- Spins  
  - An aggravated stall that results in the airplane descending in a helical, or corkscrew path  
  - Stall is a prerequisite for a spin  
  - Don’t be uncoordinated  
  - Recovery:  
    - PARE  
      - Power idle  
      - Ailerons neutral  
      - Rudder full opposite (Neutralize after rotation stops)  
      - Elevator full forward (where the elevator goes varies with the aircraft; sometimes neutral or relaxed ascension)  
- Turning tendencies  
  - Gyroscopic Pression  
    - Resultant reaction when a force is applied to the rim of a rotating disc  
  - Torque Effect  
    - Newton's 3rd law  
    - propeller rotates clockwise and has a force pair that rotates counter clockwise  
  - P-Factor  
    - Asymmetric thrust on the propeller caused by the descending side of the propeller having a higher angle of attack  
  - Spiraling slipstream (corkscrew effect)  
    - As the propeller rotates, it produces a backwards flow of air, rotating around the plane  
    - Resultant force strikes the vertical fin   
- Climbs  
  - Entry  
    - In a steady climb, lift is the same as in level flights the same airspeed  
  - Airspeed  
    - w/ no change in power, airspeed will decrease in a climb  
    - component of weight acts with drag against thrust  
- Decents  
  - Lowering the nose reduces AOA and lift momentarily  
  - lift \< weight causing nose down  
- Turns  
  - Caused by horizontal component of lift  
  - Pitch back to compensate to keep vertical component of lift greater than weight  
- Load Factor  
  - Ratio of the load supported by the airplane’s wings   
  - G’s  
  - Increase in AOA   
- Adverse yaw  
  - Additional yaw from the wing with more lift  
- Overbanking tendency (30-45 degrees)  
  - Outer wing travels greater distance  
    - Higher speed more lift  
  - Inner wing travels shorter distance  
    - Lower speed less lift  
  - Plane wants to continue with momentum from outer wing
