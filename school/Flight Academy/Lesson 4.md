Collision Avoidance

- Pilot’s responsibility @ all times w/ VFR  
- VFR and VMC  
  - Visual Flight Rules  
  - Visual Meteorological Conditions  
- IFR and IMC  
  - Instrument Flight Rules  
  - Instrument Meteorological Conditions  
- Tools to avoid collisions  
  - Exterior lights  
  - Radio Transmissions  
  - Air Traffic Control services  
- Early detections of aircraft is crucial  
- Visual scanning  
  - Haze and reduced visibility make traffic and terrain features appear farther away than their actual distance  
  - Planes not moving but getting bigger means it is coming towards you  
  - Blind spots  
    - High wing above  
    - Low wing below  
- Airport Operations  
  - Extra caution operations near an airport  
  - Strobes required all the time  
  - 2 types of airports  
    - Towered  
      - ATC is responsible for providing the flow of traffic  
      - Still pilot’s responsibility to see and avoid  
    - Nontowered  
      - Radio communication isn’t required but recommended as good practice  
- Right of way rules  
  - EBGAAR  
    - Emergency  
    - Ballon  
    - Glider  
    - Aircraft refueling  
    - Airship  
    - Rotarcraft/airplane  
  - Overtaking another aircraft  
    - An overtaking aircraft must pass the slower aircraft on the right and stay well clear  
  - Approaching another aircraft head-on  
    - If 2 aircraft are approaching head on both must give way to the right  
  - Converging with another aircraft  
    - The aircraft of the same category to the rightmost has the right of way  
  - Lower aircraft have right of way  
    - No abuse of this rule  
- Minimum safe altitudes  
  - Maintain these altitudes during all flight except during takeoff and landing  
  - 2 types  
    - Congested areas  
      - 1000ft vertical requirement  
      - 2000ft horizontal radius  
    - Uncongested Areas  
      - 500ft above surface  
      - 500ft from everything else  
- Airports  
  - Knowing how to determine the correct runway to use  
    - ATUS and ATC  
    - Look at the wind sock  
  - Night flying   
    - Human factors  
- Traffic patterns  
  - 5 named legs  
    - Upwind leg  
    - Crosswind leg  
    - Downwind leg  
    - Base leg  
    - Final approach and departure  
  - Turn left unless otherwise stated  
- Runway markings  
  - Vary between runways  
  - Usually only marked with only the runway number and a dashed white centerline  
  - Displaced threshold  
    - Initial portion of pavement  
    - Obstructions normally make it impossible to land on it  
  - Area surrounding the runway for emergencies  
  - Runway Hold Position sign  
    - Stop sign  
    - Located where taxiways intersect with runways  
    - Consists of 2 solid and 2 dashed  
    - Aircraft is clear of runway when it is past the solid lines  
- Taxiway markings  
  - Non movement area  
    - ATC contact not required and uncontrolled taxiing  
  - Movement area  
    - ATC contact is required for taxiing, takeoff and landing  
  - Instruction signs  
    - Mandatory  
      - Show critical, prohibited, or entrance to a runway  
      - Red and white  
    - Location  
      - Identify taxiway or runway where your aircraft is located  
      - Yellow on black  
    - Runway distance  
      - On sides of runway  
      - 1,000 ft increments  
    - Direction signs  
      - Black on yellow  
      - Shows direction of turn  
- Runway Incursion Avoidance  
  - Where someone is in the wrong spot @ the wrong time and is dangerous  
  - Avoidance  
    - Do everything in the cockpit before you taxi  
    - Look around  
    - Write down taxi instructions  
    - Airport diagrams to direct  
    - Review NOTAMs  
    - Check for traffic before crossing any runway holding line  
    - Clear the runway as soon as possible  
  - Progressive taxi is dope (but ATC doesn't like)  
- ATC instruction  
  - Request clarification if necessary  
  - The final decision to act on ATC instruction rests with PIC  
  - Nothing wrong with telling a controller you are unable to comply  
- Land and hold short operations (LAHSO)  
  - Simultaneous operations are being conducted on intersecting runways  
  - LAHSO is ATC procedure that may require pilot participation and compliance   
  - Reduced runway distance  
  - MUST stop short  
- Visual Glideslope Indicators  
  - Red/White lights that help maintain proper glide path  
  - Want even red and white lights  
  - Red means too far down  
  - White means too far up  
  - Left side of runway  
- Pilot controlled lighting  
  - 3-7 clicks on the radio to call for lighting w/ 3 as the lowest  
- Longitude and Latitude

    - Has 2+ layers  
    - Most controlled
