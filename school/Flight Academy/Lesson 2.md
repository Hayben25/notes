Fuel pumps

- 2 types:  
  - Gravity fed  
  - Fuel pump  
- Electric Fuel pump starts first w/ starter then engine powered fuel pump takes over

Fuel Systems

- Path:  
  - Tank  
  - Selector valve  
  - Strainer

Oil systems

- Lubrication and cooling  
- Goes from tank to engine and back out to remove heat  
- Wet or dry, depending on if the oil is integrated into the engine or not respectively  
- If oil is too hot or pressure is too low probably too little oil  
  - Important when using a high power setting and slow airspeed (maneuvering)  
  - If happens during flight use as much air as possible to cool

Propellers

- Like a sideways wing but sideways and produces thrust   
- 2 types  
  - Fixed pitch  
    - High angle of attack for cruise  
    - Low angle of attack for climb  
  - Variable pitch  
- Curve in airfoil creates uniform lift

Electrical system

- Battery  
  - Starts engine  
- Alternator  
  - 14V or 28V dc current powered by an engine driven alternator  
- Ammeter  
  - Measures current  
- Master switch  
  - Controls entire electrical system except for the ignition system  
  - Make sure this is off at the end of a flight b/c battery will die   
- Circuit breakers and fuses  
  - Prevents electrical overloads (only 2-3 times per breaker)  
- Standby battery  
  - Isolated for redundancy  
  - Normally can run for 30 minutes   
- Pitot static instruments  
  - Airspeed indicator  
    - Only one that uses the pitot indicator  
    - Uses a combination of static pressure and ram pressure to calculate air speed  
    - Reads something called indicated airspeed (IAS)  
    - Calibrated airspeed (CAS)  
      - % error of indicated airspeed  
      - Greatest at low airspeeds  
    - True airspeed  
      - CAS corrected for altitude and nonstandard temperature  
      - TAS \- CAS  varies directly with altitude  
    - Groundspeed  
      - Speed of airplane over the ground  
      - TAS adjusted for wind correction  
  - Altimeter  
    - Height of an aircraft above a given pressure level  
    - Only uses static port, no pitot  
    - Uses an aneroid wafer as main component  
      - Sealed wafer that is evacuated to an internal pressure of 29.92 inches of mercury  
      - Expands and contracts with static pressure  
    - Air is densest at sea level  
    - Altitude is relative to mean sea level (MSL)  
    - Types of altitude:  
      - Indicated altitude   
        - Read from altimeter  
      - True altitude  
        - Vertical of the aircraft above sea level (aka actual altitude)  
        - Also MSL  
      - Absolute altitude  
        - ASL  
        - Vertical distance above the terrain or ground level  
      - Pressure altitude  
        - Altitude when your altimeter setting window is set to 29.92 “Hg  
        - For performance calculations and learning  
        - Pressure altitude \= (29.92 \- altimeter setting) \* 1000 \+ Elevation  
      - Density altitude (DA)  
        - Pressure altitude corrected for variations from standard temperature  
        - DA \= PA \+ (120\*(OAT \- ISA))  
        - 2 degrees C per 1000 ft  
        - Performance metric  
        - Density altitude varies indirectly with performance   
  - Vertical speed indicator (VSI)  
    - Indicates whether it is climbing or descending in level flight  
      - Delayed indication  
    - Uses a diaphragm with a calibrated leak to account for changes in elevation  
    - Shows trend indication and stabilized rate of change in altitude  
- Gyroscopic instruments  
  - Gyroscopic Principles  
    - Gyro stays oriented  
      - Rigidy in space  
      - Precession  
        - Force happens 90 degrees later in the rotation  
    - Sources of power  
      - Redundant power sources so there is at least one source of bank information  
      - Air is drawn into vacuum by engine driven pump  
    - Monitor vacuum pressure to keep accurate readings  
  - Attitude Indicator  
    - Uses horizon line and model of plane to show relation to horizon irl  
  - Turn coordinator  
    - 2 types:  
      - Turn-and-slip indicators  
        - Shows rate of turn in degrees per second  
      - Turn coordinators  
  - Heading indicator  
    - More accurate for more time than a magnetic compass  
      - Has to be recalibrated  
    - Uses a gimbal  
- Magnetic compass  
  - Earth is a big magnet so it has flux that a compass aligns with  
  - Errors:  
    - Variation  
      - East is least; west is best (-/+ on compass heading)  
      - Magnetic poles aren’t exactly at true north  
      - Variation is the difference between magnetic north and true north from the location of measurement  
    - Deviation  
      - Everything with a current has a magnetic field which will effect the magnetic compass even though the induced magnetic field is not as strong as the earth magnetic field, because it is closer (inverse square law)  
    - Northerly turning errors  
      - Compass wants to point north  
      - Stop turning 15 degrees before desired heading to avoid the error  
    - Southerly Turning Errors  
      - Compass doesn't want to go south  
      - Overshoot southward turns to correct error  
      - 15 degree rule applies but opposite  
    - Acceleration errors  
      - Inertia bad (especially east/west headings)  
      - Tries to turn north when accelerating   
      - Tries to turn south when slowing down  
    - Oscillation Error  
      - Combo error   
      - Use average to approximate  
- Air Data Computer (ADC) (the one we have)  
  - Computes the altitude, airspeed and vertical speed  
  - Uses temperature gauge to correct for temperature errors  
- Attitude Heading Reference System (AHRS)  
  - Provides more accurate data through the use of electromagnetic gyros, accelerometers, and a magnetometer or flux valve  
- Air Data Attitude Heading Reference System (ADAHRS)  
  - Combo of ADC and AHRS  
- Gear reduction box  
  - Tecnam P2002S has a gear reduction of 2.4:1  
    - Everytime prop spins the engine spins 2.4 times
