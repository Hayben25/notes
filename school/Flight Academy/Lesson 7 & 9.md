Atmospheric Circulation

- [Aviationweather.gov](http://Aviationweather.gov)  
- All weather conditions are caused by the uneven heating of the Earth  
- Convection  
  - Warm air goes to the poles, cools and then returns to the equator  
- 3 forces affect the flow of wind  
  - Pressure Gradient Force (PGF)  
    - How abruptly the pressure is changing  
    - Wind flows from high to low pressure  
    - Windspeed is proportional to the PGF  
    - Kinda looks like a topography map  
      - Isobars  
  - Coriolis force  
    - Wind up in the air gets cast in the direction of the Earth’s rotation  
    - Good for long distances at altitude (W → E in northern hemisphere E→W in southern hemisphere)  
  - Friction  
    - Below 3000ft air moves differently  
    - Pressure systems act like curvy electric fields above 3000ft  
      - High pressure does down and out curved in the cw  
      - Low pressure does up and in curved in the ccw  
  - Stable atmosphere resists changes in vertical motion  
- Dangers of wind  
  - Wind shear  
    - Large changes in wind velocity  
    - Commonly associated with:  
      - Passing frontal system  
      - Thunderstorms  
      - Temperature inversions  
        - “Capped area of warmer air”  
        - Doesn't get colder while ascending for a little bit  
      - How it’s dangerous:  
        - Decrease airplane performance rapidly  
          - Violent down or updrafts  
  - Mountain waves  
    - Mountains really push air  
    - Clouds can help show the wind patterns  
    - Mountain wave turbulence  
  - Headwind vs Tailwind  
    - Taking off/Landing: Headwind \> Tailwind  
    - Cruise: Headwind \< Tailwind  
- Temperature  
  - All weather is caused by a transfer of energy (The heating and cooling of the earth’s surface)  
  - Water cools slower than land which helps regulate temperature  
  - Temperature decreases @ an average of 2 C per 1000ft  
    - Isothermal layer: temperature remains the same with height  
    - Temperature Inversion: temperature increases with height  
- Moisture  
  - Necessary Ingredients  
    - Water vapor  
    - Lifting action  
    - Growth process  
  - Types of precipitation  
    - Rain  
      - Virga is when rain evaporates before it hits the ground  
        - Like venus  
    - Ice pellets  
      - Caused by temperature inversion (freezes melts, and refreezes)  
      - Hail is just condensed ice pellets   
    - Freezing rain  
    - Snow  
  - Dewpoint  
    - Temperature the air needs to be cooled to achieve a relative humidity of 100% at this point if there is any moisture then it will turn into clouds or precipitation  
    - The higher the dewpoint the more moisture in the air  
    - If the temperature and dewpoint are close or equal except fog or clouds  
  - Humidity  
    - Amount of water vapor in the atmosphere at a given time  
    - Relative humidity is the actual amount of moisture in the air compared to max amount of moisture that can be held  
  - Clouds  
    - Clouds are formed from vertical motion water vapor (droplets or ice crystals)  
    - The only type of ceiling are a broken or overcast layer  
      - ⅝ to ⅞ cloud coverage  
    - Vertical motion  
      - Integral to cloud formation  
      - Types of vertical motion  
        - Orographic  
          - Air moving over terrain  
        - Frictional (High and low pressure)  
        - Frontal lift  
          - Like a converging boundary but for fronts  
        - Bouyancy  
    - Types of Clouds  
      - High (cirrus, cirro)  
        - Cirrus  
        - Cirrostratus

        - Straticummulus  
        - Nimbostratus  
        - Below 6500AGL  
      - Nimb- or \-nimb means rain  
      - Clouds with vertical development  
        - Cumulus, towering cumulus, and cumulonimbus  
        - Thunder  
  - Fog  
    - Visible small water droplets at the surface  
    - There are multiple types of fog, and you should be familiar with the conditions that could cause them  
      - Radiation Fog  
        - Radiation cools the ground, the ground cools the air, and fog forms  
      - Advection fog  
        - Moist air moves over a colder surface, cooling it below the dew point  
        - Common among coastal areas  
      - Upslope fog  
        - Moist stable air cooling to the dewpoint as it moves up sloping terrain  
      - Frontal fog  
        - When warm, moist air air is lifted over a front, clouds and precipitation may form  
        - Like a sheet over the front, causing fog underneath the front  
      - Freezing fog  
        - Water droplets freezing  
        - Could attach to aircraft (that’s bad)  
    - Strong winds (over 15 knots) some kinds of fog  
  - Air masses  
    - Classified based on temperature and moisture present in the source region  
      - C \= continental  
      - M \= Maritime  
    - Temperature: Arctic, polar, tropical  
    - Fronts  
      - Boundary between two air masses  
      - Detectable in several ways:  
        - Significant temperature gradients  
        - Converging winds  
      - Cold Front  
        - Steep slope  
        - Warm air is forced up abruptly  
          - Makes clouds fast and causes storms  
      - Warm front  
        - Gentle slope  
        - Warm air rises gradually   
          - Makes clouds from warm moist air  
      - Stationary front  
        - Fronts hit each other  
        - Clouds and precipitation form in the warm rising air along the front  
      - Occluded front  
        - Cold front typically moving faster than warm fronts  
        - Cold air undercuts a retreating cooler air mass further lifting the already rising warm air  
        - Bad weather  
  - Turbulence  
    - Convective  
      - Caused by uneven heating

    - Per FAR 91.527 \- No pilot may take off an airplane that has frost, ice, or snow adhering to the airplane  
    - Frost is dew that is frozen  
    - Changes all of the forces of flight, making it dangerous  
      - Lift could decrease by 30%  
      - Drag could increase by 40%  
      - Adds weight to the aircraft
