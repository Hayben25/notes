- Suppose that $f(x,y)$ is a non-constant function that is continiously differentiable. That means *f* is differentiable and its gradient $\nabla f$ is continuous. We saw last class that at each point in the domain $\nabla f$ (if $\ne$ 0) points in the direciton of the most rapid increase of *f*. Also, at each point of the domain, the gradient vector $\nabla f$ (if $\ne$ 0) is perpendicular to the level curve of *f* that passes through that point.
	- Why?
	- Let $r(t)$ parametric the level curve $f(x,y)=c$
	- $\frac{d}{dt}(f(r(t)))=\frac{d}{dt}c$
	- $\nabla f(r(t))\cdot r'(t)=0$
	- For each t,
		- $\nabla f(r(t)) \bot r'(t)$ 
- The vector
	- $t(x_0,y_0)=\frac{\partial f}{\partial y}(x_0,y_0)\hat{i}-\frac{\partial f}{\partial x}(x_0,y_0)\hat{j}$
	- Is perpendicular to the gradient so it is the tangent vector to the curve *C*
	- This is useful when we don't have or don't want to find a parameterization of stuff
	- The equation of the tangent line is:
		- $\frac{\partial f}{\partial x}(x_0,y_0)(x-x_0)+\frac{\partial f}{\partial y}(x_0,y_0)(y-y_0)=0$ 
		- 2 ways to see this
			- Movement on L from $(x_0,y_0)$ to any (x,y) is of form d=(x-x_0,y-y_0) $\nabla f(x_0,y_0)\bot d\implies \nabla f(x_0,y_0)\cdot d=0$
			- Symmetric form of the line through $(x_0,y_0)$ w/ $d=\overrightarrow{t}(x_0,y_0)\implies\frac{x-x_0}{\frac{\partial f}{\partial y}(x_0,y_0)}=\frac{y-y_0}{\frac{\partial f}{\partial x}(x_0,y_0)}$
	- And the equation of the normal line is:
		- $\frac{\partial f}{\partial y}(x_0,y_0)(x-x_0)+\frac{\partial f}{\partial x}(x_0,y_0)(y-y_0)=0$
		- Movement along line is $d=(x-x_0,y-y_0) \overrightarrow{t}(x_0,y_0)\bot d$
		- $\frac{\partial f}{\partial y}(x_0,y_0)(x-x_0)-\frac{\partial f}{\partial x}(x_0,y_0)(y-y_0)=0$
- For $f(x,y,z)$ the equation for the **tangent plane** is
	- $f_x(x_0,y_0,z_0)(x-x_0)+f_y(x_0,y_0,z_0)(y-_0)+f_z(x_0,y_0,z_0)(z-z_0)=0$
	- And the **normal line** is:
		- $x=x_0+\frac{\partial f}{\partial x}(x_0,y_0,z_0)t$
		- $y=y_0+\frac{\partial f}{\partial y}(x_0,y_0,z_0)t$
		- $z=z_0+\frac{\partial f}{\partial z}(x_0,y_0,z_0)t$
	- $overrightarrow{N}=\nabla f(x,y,z)$

## Example
1. Write an equation for the tangent line and an equation for the normal line at point *P*.
	- $x^2+xy+y^2=7$ $P(1,-3)$
	- We need a function $f(x,y)$ so that our curve is a level curve of this function. Define $f(x,y)=x^2+xy+y^2$ so that curve is $f(x,y)=7$. Note $f(1,-3)=1^2+1(-3)+(-3)^2=7$
	- $\nabla f(x,y)=(2x+y,x+2y)$, $\nabla f(1,-3)=(2-3,1-6)=(-1,-5)$
	- Thus $(-1,-5)$ is normal to curve @ $(1,-3)$ $\overrightarrow{t}=(-5,1)$
		- Tangent line: $-(x-1)-5(y+3)=0$
		- Normal line: $-5(x-1)+1(y+3)=0$, or $-5(x-1)+y+3=0$
	- Check: Let $g(x,y)=-(x-1)-5(y+3)$
		- $\nabla g = (-1,-5)$
2. Find an equation for the tangenet plane and scalar parametric equations for the normal line at the point $P$
	- $x^3+y^3=3xyz$, $P(1,2,\frac{3}{2})$
	- Let $f(x,y,z)=x^3+y^3-3xyz$, our surface $f(x,y,z)=0$
	- $\nabla f(x,y,z)=(3x^2-3yz,3y^2-3xz,-3xy)$
3. Find the point(s) on the surface at which the tangent plane is horizontal
	- $z-2x^2-2xy+y^2+5x-3y+2=0$
	- What does it mean to have a horizontal plane? $z=K$
	- We need a normal vector $\overrightarrow{N}=(0,0,c)=c\hat{k}$, $c\ne 0$
	- Define $g(x,y,z)=z-2x^2-2xy+y^2+5x-3y+2$, surface is $g(x,y,z)=0$
		- $\nabla g(x,y,z)=(-4x-2y+5,2y-2x-3,1)$
		- We need $(x,y,z)$ so that $\nabla g(x,y,z)=(0,0,1)$, 1 is here because it is $\nabla g \hat{k}$ 
	- $\therefore -4x-2y-5=0$, $-2x+2y-3=0$
		- $\implies x=\frac{1}{3}\implies y=\frac{11}{6}$
		- What is z? $g(x,y,z)=0\implies z=-\frac{1}{12}$
	- Our point is $(\frac{1}{3},\frac{11}{6},-\frac{1}{12})$
	- Our plane $z=-\frac{1}{12}$
4. Find the point(s) on the surface at which the tangent plane is horizontal
	- $f(x,y)=2x^2+2xy-y^2-5x+3y-2$
	- **Important**! For a plane, we need a 3D normal vector but $\nabla f(x,y)$ is a 2D vector
		- Where is z here?
			- Our surface is graph of $f(x,y)$, that is $(x,y,f(x,y))$ 
	- Let $g(x,y,z)=z-f(x,y)$ (our surface is $g(x,y,z)=0$)
		- $g(x,y,z)=z-2x^2-2xy+y^2+5x-3y+2$
		- $\nabla g(x,y,z)=(-4x-2y+5,-2x+2y-3,1)$
			- $\nabla g(x,y,z)=(-f_x(x,y),-f_y(x,y),1)$ 
	- Key observation: For a horizontal plane to graph of $z=f(x,y)$, we need $\nabla f(x,y)=\overrightarrow{0}$ 
	- Set $4x+2y-5=0$, $2x-2y-3=0$
		- $\implies x=\frac{1}{3}$,$y=\frac{11}{6}$, $f(\frac{1}{3},\frac{11}{6})=-\frac{1}{12}$
	- $\therefore\ P(\frac{1}{3},\frac{11}{6},-\frac{1}{12})$
