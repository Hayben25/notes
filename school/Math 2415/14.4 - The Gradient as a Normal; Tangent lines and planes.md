- Suppose that $f(x,y)$ is a non-constant function that is continiously differentiable. That means *f* is differentiable and its gradient $\nabla f$ is continuous. We saw last class that at each point in the domain $\nabla f$ (if $\ne$ 0) points in the direciton of the most rapid increase of *f*. Also, at each point of the domain, the gradient vector $\nabla f$ (if $\ne$ 0) is perpendicular to the level curve of *f* that passes through that point.
	- Why?
	- Let $r(t)$ parametric the level curve $f(x,y)=c$
	- $\frac{d}{dt}(f(r(t)))=\frac{d}{dt}c$
	- $\nabla f(r(t))\cdot r'(t)=0$
	- For each t,
		- $\nabla f(r(t)) \bot r'(t)$ 
- The vector
	- $t(x_0,y_0)=\frac{\partial f}{\partial y}(x_0,y_0)\hat{i}-\frac{\partial f}{\partial x}(x_0,y_0)\hat{j}$
	- Is perpendicular to the gradient so it is the tangent vector to the curve *C*
	- This is useful when we don't have or don't want to find a parameterization of stuff
	- The equation of the tangent line is:
		- $\frac{\partial f}{\partial x}(x_0,y_0)(x-x_0)+\frac{\partial f}{\partial y}(x_0,y_0)(y-y_0)=0$ 
		- 2 ways to see this
			- Movement on L from $(x_0,y_0)$ to any (x,y) is of form d=(x-x_0,y-y_0) $\nabla f(x_0,y_0)\bot d\implies \nabla f(x_0,y_0)\cdot d=0$
			- Symmetric form of the line through $(x_0,y_0)$ w/ $d=\overrightarrow{t}(x_0,y_0)\implies\frac{x-x_0}{\frac{\partial f}{\partial y}(x_0,y_0)}=\frac{y-y_0}{\frac{\partial f}{\partial x}(x_0,y_0)}$
	- And the equation of the normal line is:
		- $\frac{\partial f}{\partial y}(x_0,y_0)(x-x_0)+\frac{\partial f}{\partial x}(x_0,y_0)(y-y_0)=0$
		- Movement along line is $d=(x-x_0,y-y_0) \overrightarrow{t}(x_0,y_0)\bot d$
		- $\frac{\partial f}{\partial y}(x_0,y_0)(x-x_0)-\frac{\partial f}{\partial x}(x_0,y_0)(y-y_0)=0$

## Example
1. Write an equation for the tangent line and an equation for the normal line at point *P*.
	- $x^2+xy+y^2=7$ $P(1,-3)$
