## Properties of gradients:
- $\nabla|f(x)+g(x)|=\nabla f(x)+\nabla g(x)$
- $\nabla |\alpha f(x)|=\alpha \nabla f(x)$
- $\nabla |f(x)g(x)|=\nabla f(x)g(x) + f(x)\nabla g(x)$

## Directional Derivatives

- $f'$ gives the directional derivative of $f$ in the direction u. In other words, $f'_u$ gives the rate of change of $f$ in the direction of u
	- $f_u'(x)=\nabla f(x)\cdot \overrightarrow{u}$
	- $\overrightarrow{u}$ is a unit vector
	- Tis' a component of the $\nabla f(\overrightarrow{x})$ in $\overrightarrow{u}$ direction
	- What is the directional derivative of f in the $\hat{i}$ direction?
		- $f_\hat{i}(x,y,z)=\nabla f(x,y,z)\cdot \hat{i}=(f_x,f_y,f_z)\cdot (1,0,0)=f_x$
- Note that the directional derivative in a direction **u**  is the component of the gradient vector in that direction
	- $f'_u(x)=comp_u \nabla f(x)$.
	- Fact: $-||\nabla f(\overrightarrow{x})|| \le f'_{\overrightarrow{u}}(\overrightarrow{x})$
	- Important:
		- From each point x of the domain, a differentiable function *f* increases most rapidly in the generation of the gradient (the rate of change at x being $||\nabla f(x)||$ )

## Example

1. Find the directional derivative at the point $P$ in the direction of 
2. Find the directional derivative for $f(x,y)=x^2+3y^2$ at $Q(-1,\frac{1}{2})$ towards $R(2,\frac{3}{2})$
	- $\nabla f(x,y)=(2x,6y)$, $\overrightarrow{d}=\overrightarrow{QR}=(3,1)$
	- $\nabla f(Q)=\nabla f(-1,\frac{1}{2})=(-2,3)$
	  $f'_d(Q)=\nabla f(-1,\frac{1}{2})\cdot \overrightarrow{u_d}=(-2,3)\cdot \frac{1}{\sqrt{10}$
3. Find a unit vector in the direction in which $f$ increases most rapidly at P and give the rate of change of $f$ in that direction: find a unit vector in the direction in which *f* decreases most rapidly at P and give the rate of change of *f* in that direction
	- $f(x,y)=y^2e^{2x}$ at $P(0,1)$
	- $\nabla f(x,y)=(2y^2e^{2x},2ye^{2x})$, $f(0,1)=(2,2)$
	- Direction increaes most rapidly: $\overrightarrow{u}=\frac{1}{||\nabla f(0,1)||}$
