- The *quadratic surfaces* are surfaces that can be written in the form:
	- $Ax^2+By^2+Cz^2+Dxy+Exz+Fyz+Hx+Iy+Jz+K=0$
		- Where $A,B,C,...,K$ are constants
		- Book has examples

## Projection

- Suppose you have 2 surfaces that intersect in a space curve C:
	- The curve C is the set of all $(x,y,z)$ such that $z=f(x,y)$ and $z=g(x,y)$ and so that the set of all points $(x,y,z)$ such that $f(x,y)=g(x,y)$ create a vertical cylinder through C. If we find all the points $(x,y,0)$

## Example

1. Determine the projection on the xy-plane:
	- $y^2+z-4=0$ (parabolic cylinder) & $x^2+3y^2=z$ (elliptic paroboloid)
	- Set $z=f(x,y)=4-y^2,z=g(x,y)=x^2+3y^2$
		- $4-y^2=x^2+3y^2$
		- $1=\frac{1}{4}x^2+y^2$
	- Our projection is an ellipse in xy-plane as a set
2. A sphere $x^2+y^2+(z-1)^2=\frac{3}{2}$ and the hyperboloid $x^2+y^2-z^2=1$ intersect in a space curve C. Determine the projection of C onto the xy-plane.
	- Note: we cannot solve for z as $f(x,y)$
		- Here use $x^2+y^2$ is in both equations (OoOh!)
