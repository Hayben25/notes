- Vector functions in all real numbers are the for: $f(t)=f_1(t)i+f_2(t)j+f_3(t)k$ where $f_1,f_2,f_3$ are the component functions.
- The scalar functions in the case of a line would take the form:
	- $f_1(t)=x_0+d_1t, f_2(t)=y_0+d_2t, f_3(t)=z_0+d_3t$ 
- The domain of a vector function is the set of all t's for which all the component functions are defined. It is the largest possible interval for which all 3 components are defined.
	- If they exist you can take derivatives!

# Examples

1. $f(t)=e^{2t}i+ln(3t)j+arctan(3t)k$
	- $f'(t)=(2e^{2t},\frac{1}{t},\frac{3}{1+9t^3}$
