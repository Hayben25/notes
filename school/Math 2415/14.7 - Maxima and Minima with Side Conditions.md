In section we found absolute extrema of a function on a region that contained its boundary (like we did in Calc 1 when we used a closed and bounded interval). Now we will look at a different process - we will be optimizing a function *f* subject to a constraint $g=0$. Let *f* be a function to be optimized

Method of Lagrange(stupid fr\*nch):
- ($\lambda$ is called the *Lagrange multiplier*)
- Set your constraint function = 0 (that's g)
- Then solve the system $\nabla f(x,y,z)=\lambda\nabla g(x,y,z)$ and $g(x,y,z)=0$ 
- Last, plug in all solutions (x,y,z) into *f* to identify max and min values (if they exist)
