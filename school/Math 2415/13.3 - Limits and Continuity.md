## Just a wee bit of set theory

- A set is **closed** if it contains ALL of its boundary points.
- A set is **open** if it contains NONE of its boundary points.
- A boundary point is a point that has ANY neighborhood ("close" points) that are inside and outside of the set
- Boundary of a set S is denoted "curly d S"
- Example: S=(0,1] then "fun d S"={0,1}

## Limits

- In calc 1, we said $\lim_{x \to a} f(x)$ $\iff$ $lim_{x\to a^+} f(x)=lim_{x\to a^-}f(x)$
- When substituting in x for (x,y) it gets rough
	- However if any 2 paths or curves yield different values then the limit DNE
- Note:
	- Don't put an equal sign after a limit, put it after the function

## Examples

1. $\{(x,y):2\lt x\lt 5, 4\lt y \lt 6\}$
	- The set is open
	- fun d $S=\{(x,y) | 2\le x \le 5, y=4$ or $y=6\}\cup \{(x,y)|x=2$ or $x=5, 4\le y\le 6\}$
2. $\{(x,y):2\le x \le 5,4\le y \le 6\}$
	- Boundary is now contained in S Write fun d $S\subseteq S$ 
3. $\{(x,y):2\le x \le 5,4\lt y \lt 6\}$
	- S is not open since $(2,5)\in S$
	- S is not closed since $(2,4)\notin S$
4. $S=\{(x,y):y\le x^2\}$
	- Boundary $S={(x,y)|y=x^2}$
	- S is closed
5. $S=\{(x,y,z): x^2+y^2\le 1, z\gt 1\}$
	- Why is S not open?
		- $(1,0,2)\in S$
	- Why is S not closed?
		- $(0,0,1)\notin S$
	- Boundary $S=\{(x,y,z)| x^2+y^2\le 1, z=1\}\cup \{(x,y,z)| x^2+y^2=1, z\ge 1\}$
6. Find $lim_{(x,y)\to (0,0)}f(x)$ for $f(x,y)=\frac{y^2}{x^2+y^2}$
	- Suspect limit DNE
	- Let's show this using paths (curves) through (0,0)
	- Examples!
		- x-axis, y=0
			- Look at $f(x,0)$
		- y-axis, x= 0
			- Look at $f(0,y)$
		- y=mx, $f(x,mx)$
		- y=x$^2$, $f(x,x^2)$
		- y=sin(x), $f(x,sin(x))$
	- $lim_{y\rightarrow 0} f(0,y)$
		- $f(0,y)=\frac{y^2}{y^2}=1$
	- $lim_{x\rightarrow 0} f(x,x^2)$
		- $f(x,x^2)=\frac{x^4}{x^2+x^4}$
		- Use L'Hopitals rule
		- Limit = 0
	- With these 2 limits we can say that the limit DNE
7. Find lim as (x,y) $\rightarrow$ (1,2) for $f(x,y)=\frac{y^2}{x^2+y^2}$
	- This function is continuous except @ (0,0)
	- Thus lim as $(x,y) \rightarrow (0,0) =f(1,2)=\frac{4}{5}$
8. Show that the function $f(x,y)=\frac{x^2y}{x^4+y^2}$ has a limit as (x,y)$\rightarrow$(0,0) along *any* line through the orgin but  lim as (x,y) $\rightarrow$ (0,0) for $f(x,y)$ still does not exist
	- y=mx
		- $f(x,mx)=\frac{mx^3}{x^4+m^2x^2} \implies lim=\frac{mx}{x^2+m^2}=0$
	- y-axis (x=0)
		- $lim=0$
	- Thus for any line through (0,0) f(x,y) approaches 0
	- y=x$^2$
		- $f(x,x^2)=\frac{x^4}{x^4+x^4}$ approaches $\frac{1}{2}$ 
	- Since that is different from the other ones then the limit DNE
