## Just a wee bit of set theory

- A set is **closed** if it contains ALL of its boundary points.
- A set is **open** if it contains NONE of its boundary points.
- A boundary point is a point that has ANY neighborhood ("close" points) that are inside and outside of the set
- Boundary of a set S is denoted "curly d S"
- Example: S=(0,1] then "fun d S"={0,1}

## Limits

- In calc 1, we said lim f(x) as $x\rightarrow a$ exists $\iff$ $lim f(x)$ as $x\rightarrow a^+=lim f(x)$ as $x\rightarrow a^-$
- When substituting in x for (x,y) it gets rough
	- However if any 2 paths or curves yield different values then the limit DNE
- Note:
	- Don't put an equal sign after a limit, put it after the function

## Examples

1. $\{(x,y):2\lt x\lt 5, 4\lt y \lt 6\}$
	- The set is open
	- fun d $S=\{(x,y) | 2\le x \le 5, y=4$ or $y=6\}\cup \{(x,y)|x=2$ or $x=5, 4\le y\le 6\}$
2. $\{(x,y):2\le x \le 5,4\le y \le 6\}$
	- Boundary is now contained in S Write fun d $S\subseteq S$ 
3. $\{(x,y):2\le x \le 5,4\lt y \lt 6\}$
	- S is not open since $(2,5)\in S$
	- S is not closed since $(2,4)\notin S$
4. $S=\{(x,y):y\le x^2\}$
	- Boundary $S={(x,y)|y=x^2}$
	- S is closed
5. $S=\{(x,y,z): x^2+y^2\le 1, z\gt 1\}$
	- Why is S not open?
		- $(1,0,2)\in S$
	- Why is S not closed?
		- $(0,0,1)\notin S$
	- Boundary $S=\{(x,y,z)| x^2+y^2\le 1, z=1\}\cup \{(x,y,z)| x^2+y^2=1, z\ge 1\}$
