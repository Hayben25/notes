So far, we have used Polar, Cylindrical, and Spherical coordinates to make some of our integration problems easier. In calc 1, we used u-sub to make some integration easier. We are now going to do something similar but now we will change the xy-coordinates into uv-coordinates. To do that, we will need to transform our region too.

## Example

1. Transform the given region $\Omega:\ x^2+\frac{y^2}{36}=1$ into $\tau$ using the transformation $x=\frac{1}{2}u,\ y=3v$
	- $1=x^2+\frac{y^2}{36}=(\frac{1}{2}u)^2+\frac{1}{36}(3v)^2=\frac{1}{4}u^2+\frac{9}{36}v^2=\frac{1}{4}(u^2+v^2)\implies 4=u^2+v^2$
