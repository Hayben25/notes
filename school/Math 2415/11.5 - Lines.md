# Lines

- Vector form: $r(t)=(x_0\hat{i}+y_0\hat{j}+z_0\hat{k})+t(d_1\hat{i}+d_2\hat{j}+d_3\hat{k})$
- Scalar form:
	- $x(t)=x_0+td_1$
	- $y(t)=y_0+td_2$
	- $z(t)=z_0+td_3$
- Symmetric form: $\frac{x-x_0}{d_1}=\frac{y-y_0}{d_2}=\frac{z-z_0}{d_3}$
	- no value of $d_c$ can be 0 if this form is used
		- value would then be whatever the initial value is (e.x $z=z_0$)
- Symmetric is not very useful
- Parallel lines have direction vectors that are scalar multiples of each other
- 4 cases of line
	- Let $\overrightarrow{d_1}$ and $\overrightarrow{d_2}$ be the direction vectors for $l_1$, $l_2$
	- Parallel- $\overrightarrow{d_1}//\overrightarrow{d_2} \iff \overrightarrow{d_1}=\alpha \overrightarrow{d_2}$  
	- Intersect- Share a point. There are some $t_0$, $u_0$ so that $\overrightarrow{r}(t_0)=\overrightarrow{R}(u_0)$
	- Coincident- Same line w/ potentially different parameterizations ($//$ and intersecting)
	- Skew- Neither $//$ nor intersecting
- To find the angle between 2 lines:
	- $cos\theta = |u_d\cdot u_D|$, $\theta\epsilon[0,\frac{\pi}{2}]$
- Distance from a point to a line:
	- $d(P,I)=\frac{||\overrightarrow{P_0P}\times{\overrightarrow{d}}||}{||\overrightarrow{d}||}$ 
# Examples

1. Find a vector parameterization for the line that passes through $P(3,2,3)$ is parallel to the line $r(t)=(i+j-k)+t(2i+3j-3k)$
	- $r_{||}(u)=(3i+2j+3k)+u(2i+3j-3k)$  **Find out how to optimize
2. Give the answer to 1 in scalar form
	- Line: $r_{||}(u)=(3i+2j+3k)+u(2i+3j-3k)$ 
		- $x_{u}=3+2u$
		- $y_{u}=2+3u$
		- $z_{u}=3-3u$
	- Symmetric:
		- $\frac{x-3}{2}=\frac{y-2}{3}=\frac{z-3}{-3}$
3. Give the symmetric form for the line that passes through $P(2,2,1)$ and $Q(2,-2,-3)$
	- Point: either $P$ or $Q$
	- Direction: (0,-4,-4) or -4(0,1,1)$\implies$(0,1,1) because magnitude doesn't matter
	- Line: $x=2$, $\frac{y-2}{1}=\frac{z-1}{1}$
4. Find a set of scalar parametric equations for the line that passes through $P(1,2,-3)$ and is perpendicular to the xz-plane
	- $\implies$ || y-azis
		- use $\overrightarrow{d}=\hat{j}=(0,1,0)$
	- Line:
		- x=1
		- y=2+t
		- z=-3
5. Give a vector parameterization for the line that passes through $P$(1,2,-2) and is parallel to the line: 3(x-1)=2(y-2)=6(z+2)
	- 3(x-1)=2(y-2)=6(z+2) $\implies$ $\frac{x-1}{2}=\frac{y-2}{3}=z+2$
	- $\overrightarrow{d}=(2,3,1)$ (Yay whole numbers)
	- Line: $r(t)=(1,2,-2)+t(2,3,1)$
6. Determine whether the lines $l_1$ and $l_2$ are $//$, coincident, skew or intersecting. If they intersect, find the point of intersection
	-  $l_1: r(t)=(-\hat{i}+2\hat{j}+\hat{k})+t(\hat{i}-3\hat{j}+2\hat{k})$
	- $l_2:R(u)=(2\hat{i}-\hat{j})+u(-2\hat{i}+6\hat{j}-4\hat{k})$
	- Parallel because $d_{l_1}=\alpha d_{l_2}$ where $\alpha=-2$
		- Since $l_1//l_2$, if they share 1 point they share all points.
	- Intersect
		- Is $\overrightarrow{r}(0)=(-1,2,1)$ on $l_2$?
		- Plug in $(-1,2,1)$ for the scalar form of $l_2$
		- There is no solution for $u$ so $l_1$ and $l_2$ don't intersect
7. Determine case of lines:
	- $l_1:x_1(t)=1+t,y_1(t)=-1-t,z_1(t)=-4+2t$
	- $l_2:x_2(u)=1-u,y_2(u)=1+3u,z_2(u)=2u$
	- Parallel
		- There is no value of $\alpha$ that will satisfy $d_{l_1}=\alpha d_{l_2}$
	- Intersect
		- Use a system of equations to solve for values and check with the $3^{rd}$ unused equation
		- For this example the POI $(x_1(1),y_1(1),z_1(1))=(x_2(-1),y_2(-1),z_2(-1))=(2,-2,-2)$
8. Determine the case of lines:
	- $l_1:x_1(t)=3+2t,y_1(t)=-1+4t,z_1(t)=2-t$
	- $l_2:x_2(u)=3+2u,y_2(u)=2+u,z_2(u)=-2+2u$
	- There is no value of $\alpha$ that will satisfy $d_{l_1}=\alpha d_{l_2}$ so the lines are not parallel
	- There is no solution for any combination of the 2 lines that form a system of equations that will equal each other, therefore there is no POI
	- Since the lines aren't parallel and they don't intersect then they are skew
