# Lines

- Vector form: $r(t)=(x_0\hat{i}+y_0\hat{j}+z_0\hat{k})+t(d_1\hat{i}+d_2\hat{j}+d_3\hat{k})$
- Scalar form:
	- $x(t)=x_0+td_1$
	- $y(t)=y_0+td_2$
	- $z(t)=z_0+td_3$
- Symmetric form: $\frac{x-x_0}{d_1}=\frac{y-y_0}{d_2}=\frac{z-z_0}{d_3}$
	- no value of $d_c$ can be 0 if this form is used
		- value would then be whatever the initial value is (e.x $z=z_0$)
- Symmetric is not very useful
- Parallel lines have direction vectors that are scalar multiples of each other

# Examples

1. Find a vector parameterization for the line that passes through $P(3,2,3)$ is parallel to the line $r(t)=(i+j-k)+t(2i+3j-3k)$
	- $r_{||}(u)=(3i+2j+3k)+u(2i+3j-3k)$  **Find out how to optimize
2. Give the answer to 1 in scalar form
	- Line: $r_{||}(u)=(3i+2j+3k)+u(2i+3j-3k)$ 
		- x_{u}=3+2u
		- y_{u}=2+3u
		- z_{u}=3-3u
	- Symmetric:
		- $\frac{x-3}{2}=\frac{y-2}{3}=\frac{z-3}{-3}$
3. Give the symmetric form for the line that passes through $P(2,2,1)$ and $Q(2,-2,-3)$
	- Point: either $P$ or $Q$
	- Direction: (0,-4,-4) or -4(0,1,1)$\implies$(0,1,1) because magnitude doesn't matter
	- Line: $x=2$, $\frac{y-2}{1}=\frac{z-1}{1}$
4. Find a set of scalar parametric equations for the line that passes through $P(1,2,-3)$ and is perpendicular to the xz-plane
	- $\implies$ || y-azis
		- use $\overrightarrow{d}=\hat{j}=(0,1,0)$
	- Line:
		- x=1
		- y=2+t
		- z=-3
