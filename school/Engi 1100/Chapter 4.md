# Engineering Method

1. Recognize and understand the problem
2. Accumulate data and verify accuracy
3. Select the appropriate theory or principle
4. Make necessary assumptions
5. Solve the problem
6. Verify and check results

# Example
- Build a rectangular pen with three parallel partitions using 500 ft. of fencing. What dimensions will maximize the total area of the pen?
- $y=250-\frac{5x}{2}\implies 250x-\frac{5x^2}{2}=A\implies \frac{dA}{dx}=250-5x\implies$when $\frac{dA}{dx}=0 \rightarrow x=50 \implies$ maximum at $x=50ft \implies y=125ft$
