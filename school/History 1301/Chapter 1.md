- Theories on population
	- Landbridge between Russia and America during ice age between the bearing strait
	- South Pacific, African, and subterranean Atlantic routes are found as well

# Lithic Technology

- America was cut off from Europeans making contact different and difficult
- Consequences of isolation
	- No wheel for labor or transportation
		- Only used on toys
		- There were no animals or means to make the wheel useful
	- Lack of community
		- Agricultural revolution in the rest of the world but not in Americas
			- Revolution caused proximity to animals to become closer and non-Americans developed diseases as a result
				- They eventually developed immunities that the Americans didn't have
- Contrary to what was thought by initial European contact:
	- Some Americans had systems of writing
	- Woven cloth was worn developed from wool
	- Metal working existed in large civilizations like the Inca
- Lithic means stone
- Obsidian was also used because of its properties

# The Move Toward Agriculture

- Happened ~10,000 years ago
	- Happened all over the planet at basically the same time
- Climate changed to be warmer, making it more favorable to practice agriculture
- Eurasia didn't have as big of a latitude expanse so they don't have as much variety of crops
- 3 sisters (3 very common crops):
	- Corn
	- Beans
	- Squash
