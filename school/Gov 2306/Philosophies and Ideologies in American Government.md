# Understanding American Constitutional Development

- Two basic concepts:
	- What is the proper purpose of government?
		- When we look at constitutions, this is most related to the lists of government powers especially legislative powers
	- How do we limit government to only these purposes?
		- Elastic vs Necessary and Proper

# Questions

- What were the early ideas about government in America?
- What drove those ideas?
- How did those ideas develop and what other ideas became important?

# Early ideas about government in America

- Focused on limits on the power of government? Why?
	- Individual control over peoples own life
	- Appropriate limits to the legitimate use of organized violence
- Government and Society
	- Society always good
	- Government sometimes necessary
	- Government $\ne$ Society

# Organized Violence and the Proper Role of Government

- Classical liberalism
	- *limiting power* of government
	- *expanding* political participation
	- *allowing* the flourishing of individuals and voluntary associations
- Modern take on classical liberalism
	- The major problem of government is to allow us to live together peacefully in a society of dignified equals.
- Given up right of self enforcement
	- What are legitimate uses of violence for individuals or small groups?
		- Self defense
	- Pooled defense - no extra powers
	- Monopoly on violence: State has extra responsibilities and therefore has extra powers derived from its responsibilities
	- Various forms of extreme state power
		- Divine right of kings
		- Totalitarianism
		- Militant democracy
		- Theocracy

# Legitimate goals of government

- Protection of fundamental rights
	- Life
	- Liberty
	- Pursuit of happiness
	- Property (product of labor = life + liberty)
- Most restrained
	- "The government is best which governs not at all"
	- Pacifism
		- anarchism
		- 100% consensual government (no government?)
	- Non-aggression principle
		- Non-aggression principle: violence is only legitimate in self defense or defense of another's life, liberty, and property (product of labor)
		- Libertarianism
		- Minarchism
- Moderate restraint
	- "That government is best which governs least"
	- Minimalist violence
	- Constitutional limits on violence
	- Social contract theory
	- Humanitarian intervention (maybe)
	- "it is the mark of a civilized society to maintain organized violence at the lowest possible level..."
- Constitutional limits on violence: "Constitutional Restraint" or "Limited Sovereign Coercion"
	- The notion that the use of force by the government should be strictly limited by a constitution, whether formal or informal, which outlines when and how the government may act
	- James Buchanan, Nobel prize winning economist and constitutional theorist, argued that setting the Constitutional limits should be done with near unanimity, while "ordinary politics" can be done with majority rule or other agreed standards
	- This is closely related to social contract theory, but constitutional constraints are more specific and formal than the general principles of social contract theory
