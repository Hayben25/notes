# Understanding American Constitutional Development

- Two basic concepts:
	- What is the proper purpose of government?
		- When we look at constitutions, this is most related to the lists of government powers especially legislative powers
	- How do we limit government to only these purposes?
		- Elastic vs Necessary and Proper

# Questions

- What were the early ideas about government in America?
- What drove those ideas?
- How did those ideas develop and what other ideas became important?

# Early ideas about government in America

- Focused on limits on the power of government? Why?
	- Individual control over peoples own life
	- Appropriate limits to the legitimate use of organized violence
- Government and Society
	- Society always good
	- Government sometimes necessary
	- Government $\ne$ Society

# Organized Violence and the Proper Role of Government

- Classical liberalism
	- *limiting power* of government
	- *expanding* political participation
	- *allowing* the flourishing of individuals and voluntary associations
- Modern take on classical liberalism
	- The major problem of government is to allow us to live together peacefully in a society of dignified equals.
- Given up right of self enforcement
	- What are legitimate uses of violence for individuals or small groups?
		- Self defense
	- Pooled defense - no extra powers
	- Monopoly on violence: State has extra responsibilities and therefore has extra powers derived from its responsibilities
	- Various forms of extreme state power
		- Divine right of kings
		- Totalitarianism
		- Militant democracy
		- Theocracy

# Legitimate goals of government

- Protection of fundamental rights
	- Life
	- Liberty
	- Pursuit of happiness
	- Property (product of labor = life + liberty)
- Most restrained
	- "The government is best which governs not at all"
	- Pacifism
		- anarchism
		- 100% consensual government (no government?)
	- Non-aggression principle
		- Non-aggression principle: violence is only legitimate in self defense or defense of another's life, liberty, and property (product of labor)
		- Libertarianism
		- Minarchism
- Moderate restraint
	- "That government is best which governs least"
	- Minimalist violence
	- Constitutional limits on violence
	- Social contract theory
	- Humanitarian intervention (maybe)
	- "it is the mark of a civilized society to maintain organized violence at the lowest possible level..."
- Constitutional limits on violence: "Constitutional Restraint" or "Limited Sovereign Coercion"
	- The notion that the use of force by the government should be strictly limited by a constitution, whether formal or informal, which outlines when and how the government may act
	- James Buchanan, Nobel prize winning economist and constitutional theorist, argued that setting the Constitutional limits should be done with near unanimity, while "ordinary politics" can be done with majority rule or other agreed standards
	- This is closely related to social contract theory, but constitutional constraints are more specific and formal than the general principles of social contract theory
- Defining limits on government force
	- Social contract theory: Individuals consent to give up some freedom (submit to some coercion) in exchange for protection of their rights
	- Thomas Hobbes, argues that the social contract is necessary to prevent the "war of all against all" and that the government should have nearly unlimited power to prevent this
	- John Locke, argued that there are still basic rights not subject to coercion and people have the right to revolt against a government that violates these rights.
	- Jean-Jacques Rousseau, argued that the social contract should be based on the "general will" of the people, which is close to unanimous consent than majority will
- Humanitarian intervention:
	- Preventing or stopping human rights abuses
	- large scale action in natural disasters
	- coercive action to correct or prevent economic crises
	- scale redistribution of wealth or other resources to prevent suffering or promote equality
	- may include military intervention in other countries
	- The founders were generally opposed to foreign entanglements, though Jefferson ordered attacks on the Barbary pirates to protect American shipping
	- The founders were also opposed to large scale redistribution of wealth or resources by government, though they did support some limited social safety nets such as public education and poorhouses at the local level
	- This was the upper limit of tolerance of government action by the founders as a whole with one major exception: enforcement of slavery
- Militant democracy - suppression of political opponents perceived or labeled as threats to democracy
	- The idea that it is legitimate for a government to use force to prevent the rise of anti-democratic forces or to suppress political movements that threaten the democratic system
	- Often used to justify the suppression of political parties or movements that are seen as a threat to democracy
	- May actually be suppression of threats to the established party system
	- This is one of the outcomes of majoritarian Democracy which James Madison writing as Plubius in the Federalist Papers warned against
	- "I don't give a shit what you call it" J.D Vance, September 6, 2025
		- Vance reply to statement that illegal use of force against foreign civilians constitutes war crimes
- Realpolitik/Pragmatic statecraft: Pragmatic results matter more than idealism
	- The government should use force to pursue its national interests, regardless of moral considerations
	- Often used to justify
- Theocracy - powers granted from divine mandate
	- Force is morally justified for any reason chosen by the divinely mandated rulers
	- Often used to justify the use of force to suppress dissent or to enforce religious laws
	- Still not completely unlimited, as ideals hold it back
- Totalitarianism
	- "Ideas are more powerful than guns. We would not let our enemies have guns, why should we let them have ideas" - Joseph Stalin
	- The idea that the government should have unlimited power to control all aspects of society, including the use of force to suppress dissent and maintain control

# Philosophies of Government in America: Classical Liberalism

- *limiting power* of government
- *expanding* political participation
- *allowing* the flourishing of individuals and voluntary associations
- Modern take on Classical Liberalism
	- The major problem of government is to allow us to live together peacefully in a society of dignified equals
- Flaws in the founding
	- Slavery still existed, undermining the message of the constitution
		- Fixed with 13$^{th}$-15$^{th}$ amendments
	- Suffrage for women and slaves
		- Fixed with 19$^{th}$ amendment
		- Equal protection clause (14$^{th}$ amendment) applied to women by the Supreme Court (1971)
	- Equal Protection: Constitutional Enforcement
		- Civil Rights Act of 1964
		- Voting Rights Act of 1965
		- Civil Rights Act of 1967
		- Age Discrimination in Employment act of 1967
		- Title IX of Education Amendments (1972)
		- Equal Employment Opportunity Act (1972)
		- Rehabilitation Act (1973)
		- Civil Rights Restoration Act (1987)
		- The Americans with Disabilities Act (1991)
		- Civil Rights Act of 1991
- Why does the Constitution matter today?
	- Until we replace it officially, it is the formal guard against abuse of power and the formal list of limits on power
	- While still a human made document, it has followed the classical liberal ideal of *expanding* the circle of those protected and those participating in government
	- It puts into expression an aspiration to a political ideal that is still worth a look
- Is the Constitution a Social Contract?
	- No Treason: The Constitution of No Authority by Lysander Spooner (1870)
		- A contract requires the consent of the parties
		- The original signers and ratifiers are dead
		- New citizens are compelled to participate, there is no opportunity to consent
		- The Constitution failed to protect natural rights especially with regard to slavery
		- US government rules by coercion, not consent
