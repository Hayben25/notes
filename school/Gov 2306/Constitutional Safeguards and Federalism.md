# 2.3 Why do we care about the Constitution?

- The Constitution set out a system to limit power of government to allow for the good and limit the bad
- If we just pretend to follow it, it has no real power to limit oppression - political violence
- The Constitution has been changed, in some ways drastically to deal with some of its original flaws
- There is a process to change it further if there is unity in the desire for change, but fundamental rights are not up to simple majorities

# 2.4 How did the Constitutional design limit abuse of power?

- Separation of Powers within the federal government
- Checks and balances between individuals groups in the federal government
- Federalism: separation of powers between levels of government - state/federal
- The addition of the Bill of Rights (1$^{st}$ 10 Amendments)

# 2.8-2.12 Splitting up power to prevent abuse

- *Separate power* among competing groups with different agendas
- The power of one group *balances* the power of competing groups
- The competing interests force the groups to *check* each other's power
- No one group or individual can dominate
