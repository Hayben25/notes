# 2.3 Why do we care about the Constitution?

- The Constitution set out a system to limit power of government to allow for the good and limit the bad
- If we just pretend to follow it, it has no real power to limit oppression - political violence
- The Constitution has been changed, in some ways drastically to deal with some of its original flaws
- There is a process to change it further if there is unity in the desire for change, but fundamental rights are not up to simple majorities

# 2.4 How did the Constitutional design limit abuse of power?

- Separation of Powers within the federal government
- Checks and balances between individuals groups in the federal government
- Federalism: separation of powers between levels of government - state/federal
- The addition of the Bill of Rights (1$^{st}$ 10 Amendments)

# 2.8-2.12 Splitting up power to prevent abuse

- *Separate power* among competing groups with different agendas
- The power of one group *balances* the power of competing groups
- The competing interests force the groups to *check* each other's power
- No one group or individual can dominate

# 2.33 Free and Independent States

- States - plural, not "A Free and Independent State" singular

# 2.34 Congress: Senate

- Elected every six years
- More insulated from public opinion, more deliberative
- Originally appointed by state legislatures
	- 17th Amendment (1913)
- Intended to represent the interest of the states

# 2.35-2.38 The Interests of the States

- The Senate was intended to represent the interests of the states
- This was a compromise between large and small states
- This was necessary to pass the constitution:
	- The states were sovereign entities essentially independent nations
	- The states had to ratify the Constitution
	- The states were the original source of the federal government's power

### Review

- Separation of powers was intend to keep any group from fully controlling the federal government
- Checks and Balances were intend to pit the agendas of different groups against each other to limit the power of each
- The states were sovereign entities, essentially independent nations
- The Senate was intended to represent the interests of the states as one part of a compromise to get the states to ratify the Constitution
- Federalism: division of power between state and federal governments
- The Bill of Rights: the first 10 amendments to the Constitution limiting federal power over individuals and states
