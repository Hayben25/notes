## Review

- American philosophy: government exists for protection of individual rights from violence
- Strong central government itself has huge power for coercive use of force/violence
- Separation of Powers, Checks and Balances, Federalism created to restrain federal government power
- The Anti-Federalists wanted more protection than just limiting the government to certain enumerated powers

## 3.1 Part 1: Bill of Rights

- Restraint on *federal government*
	- The demand was for a restraint on the federal government, not state governments
	- Most state constitutions already had a bill or declaration of rights
	- Barron v. Baltimore (1833), Chief Justice John Marshall, United States Supreme Court - Bill of Rights does not apply to states

## 3.5

- Restraint on *federal government*
- First 10 amendments to Constitution
- Not an exclusive list of the rights of the people
	- No right to privacy
	- No right to vote until 15$^{th}$ amendment
	- 10$^{th}$ Amendment - Powers of the states, rights of the people - federalism

## 3.10 1$^{st}$ Amendment: Protecting expression and conscience

- Constitution of the United States: First Amendment
- No official national church
	- No automatic church membership on birth
	- No tax support for churches
	- No government payment of preacher's salaries
- No interference with state established churches
	- 1776 all 13 states had established churches
	- 1786 Virginia disestablished Church of England
	- New Hampshire 1817
	- Massachusetts (Congregationalist) 1833

## 3.14 Free exercise

- Free exercise of religion
- Citizens practice faith according to their conscience
- Engage in religious rituals
- Adopt a faith of their choosing
- In this respect, the no establishment clause doesn't conflict, it reinforces

## 3.15 Not present

- Not present in the Constitution or First Amendment:
	- The phrase "Separation of Church and State"
	- The phrase "Wall of separation between church and state"
- Important questions:
	- Should either phrase be added?
	- What relations between church and state should be allowed

## 3.16 2$^{nd}$ Amendment: Right to bear arms, independent state militias

- Constitution of the United States: Second Amendment
	- "A well regulated Militia, being necessary to the security of a free State, the right of the people to keep and bear Arms, shall not be infringed."
- There are 2 clauses
	- Clause 1 *implies* a state power - the power to have an independent militia to secure the state's freedom
	- Clause 1 explains one reason the second is desirable
- Does disagreement about the explanation (militia) negate the right of the people
	- What does well regulated mean
	- Supreme Court Justices have argued about these since at least the 1920s: We can disagree. These points are for thought

## 3.19 3$^{rd}$ Amendment: Quartering of Soldiers
