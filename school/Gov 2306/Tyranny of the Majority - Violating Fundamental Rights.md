## Democratic Paradox

- A History of Majoritarian Harm to Minorities
- The foundational principle of democracy is **majority rule**
- This very principle can become a tool for oppression when unchecked
- This is known as the **"Tyranny of the Majority"**
- It occurs when the majority's passion or interest overrides minority rights and the public good

## Part 1: The United States

- A Republic's Struggle with Majoritarian Faction
- Case Study: The Jim Crow South (1877-1960s)
	- After Reconstruction, white supremacist majorities used democratically elected state legislatures to enact a system of rigid racial hierarchy
	- **Goal:** Dismantle the 13$^{th}$ 14$^{th}$ 15$^{th}$ Amendments and codify white supremacy into law
	- Judicial Sanction: *Plessy v. Ferguson* (1896)
		- The Supreme Court upheld state-mandated segregation in a 7-1 decision
- Case Study: Japanese American Interment (WWII)
	- Fueled by public fear after Pearl Harbor, Executive Order 9066 authorized the incarceration of  ~122,000 people of Japanese descent.
	- $\frac{2}{3}$ were U.S. citizens, incarcerated without trial or evidence of wrongdoing
- Judicial Deference: *Korematsu v. U.S.* (1944)
	- The Supreme Court upheld the policy, deferring to military judgment and claims of "necessity"
	- **Violation of Rights:** The decision ignored the 5$^{th}$ Amendment (Due Process) and 14$^{th}$ Amendment (Equal Protection)
	- Justice Jackson's dissent warned the ruling would "lie about like a loaded weapon"
