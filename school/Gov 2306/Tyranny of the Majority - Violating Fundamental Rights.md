## Democratic Paradox

- A History of Majoritarian Harm to Minorities
- The foundational principle of democracy is **majority rule**
- This very principle can become a tool for oppression when unchecked
- This is known as the **"Tyranny of the Majority"**
- It occurs when the majority's passion or interest overrides minority rights and the public good

## Part 1: The United States

- A Republic's Struggle with Majoritarian Faction
- Case Study: The Jim Crow South (1877-1960s)
	- After Reconstruction, white supremacist majorities used democratically elected state legislatures to enact a system of rigid racial hierarchy
	- **Goal:** Dismantle the 13$^{th}$ 14$^{th}$ 15$^{th}$ Amendments and codify white supremacy into law
	- Judicial Sanction: *Plessy v. Ferguson* (1896)
		- The Supreme Court upheld state-mandated segregation in a 7-1 decision
- Case Study: Japanese American Interment (WWII)
	- Fueled by public fear after Pearl Harbor, Executive Order 9066 authorized the incarceration of  ~122,000 people of Japanese descent.
	- $\frac{2}{3}$ were U.S. citizens, incarcerated without trial or evidence of wrongdoing
- Judicial Deference: *Korematsu v. U.S.* (1944)
	- The Supreme Court upheld the policy, deferring to military judgment and claims of "necessity"
	- **Violation of Rights:** The decision ignored the 5$^{th}$ Amendment (Due Process) and 14$^{th}$ Amendment (Equal Protection)
	- Justice Jackson's dissent warned the ruling would "lie about like a loaded weapon"

## Part II: Canada

- Assimilation and Eugenics as Democratic Party
- From the 1880s to 1996, a system of mandatory boarding schools, passed by Parliament aimed to assimilate over 150,000 Indigenous children
	- **Violation of Rights**: The policy led to cultural genocide, systematic abuse, and thousands of deaths, violating rights to family, life, and cultural identity
- From the 1920s-70s, provinces passed legislation allowing for the force sterilization of individuals deemed "unfit"
	- **Violation of Rights:** These eugenics-based laws, supported by the electorate, dis

## Part III: Europe and Turkey

- "Wealth Tax" was applied at radically different rates based on religion
	- Non-Muslims faced confiscatory rates up to 10x higher than Muslims.
	- **Violations of Rights:** A clear violation of property rights and the principle of equal treatment under the law
- Several European nations have passed laws, often with broad public support, restricting religious attire like face-covering veils
	- **Violation of Rights:** Critics argue these bans violate the fundamental right to freedom of religion and expression, disproportionately targeting a small minority

## Conclusion: The Need fore Safeguards

- These cases show democracy is more than majority rule. To prevent tyranny, liberal democracies rely on safeguards to protect fundamental rights
- "The one pervading evil of democracy is the tyranny of the majority"
	- Lord Acton
