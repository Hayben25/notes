# Collective action challenges

- Rational individual choices $\ne$ Optimal group outcomes
- Elinor Ostrom: "failure of collective action is the 'core justification for the state'"
- The Prisoner's Dilemma
	- Classic collective action failure
	- Individual confession: best personal outcome
	- Both confess: worse off than cooperation
	- 'Cheap talk' without enforcement
	- Enforcement: core justification for state coercion
- Free rider problem
	- Group project free loader
- Public and common goods shared by everyone suffer the free rider problem
	- Roads
	- Parks
	- Clean Air
	- Clean Water
	- and...
# Security's role

- Security: the first public good
	- No central authority: who provides? who pays?
	- Inefficient individual protection
	- State of nature: constant struggle, no reliable property rights
#  Mancur Olson's "stationary bandit"

- 2 types of coercive actors
	- Roving Bandit:
		- Lawless environment
		- No incentive to protect productive capacity
		- Plunder, move on
		- Economic decay, no property rights
	- Stationary bandit
		- Long-term, stable arrangement: more profitable
		- Monopoly on violence and wealth extraction (taxation)
		- Incentive to foster and protect economic activity
		- Provides basic public goods: law, order, defense
- Genesis of the state
	- Ruler's self-interest (long-term revenue) aligns with collective interest (stable, productive society)
	- Democracy: a sophisticated stationary bandit
		- "Bandit": coalition of citizens (government)
		- Inclusive interest: leaders cater to electorate
		- Wider public goods
		- Symbiotic relationship with general welfare
# Locke's social contract

- State of nature
	- Not "war of all against all" (Hobbes)
	- Governed by "law of nature" (reason)
	- Free, equal individuals: "ought not to harm one another in their 'life, liberty, health, or possessions'"
- The social contract & property
	- Voluntarily give up natural freedom (self-enforcement)
	- Create civil society and government
	- **Primary purpose**: "preservation of their property"
		- "Property": physical possessions, life, liberty
	- Government protects pre-existing rights
- Property Rights & Revolution
	- God gave Earth to all in common
	- "Property in his own person" (body, labor)
	- Mixing labor with resources = private property
	- **Limitations**: "spoilage proviso", "enough and as good proviso"
	- Government failure $\implies$ people's right to dissolve/establish new one
# US Founding resonance

- Locke's natural rights (life, liberty, property), consent, right to revolution
# Enduring value of models

- Olson vs. Locke
	- Olson: Pragmatic, descriptive (ruler incentives, state emergence from self-interest/violence)
	- Locke: Normative, prescriptive (government legitimacy, purpose, limits based on natural rights protection)
	- Both models have security as a core function
		- Stationary bandit: protecting against rivals
		- Social contract: neutral judge, enforcement
- "Self enforcing institutions"
	- Solutions to persistent problems
	- Individuals accept compromises for long-term alliance ("repeated game")
	- Democracy: ultimate self-enforcing institution?
		- Citizens accept limits: greater overall system benefit
- Conceptual Maps
	- Illuminating "core justification for the state"
	- Tools to analyze collective action, governance structures, solutions
	- Not historical records, but conceptual maps
	- Like a simplified city map: highlights major structures, allows navigation
