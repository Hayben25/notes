# Concept of Reonance
	- Ex. $O_3$
	- Can have 2 options for double bond (on right or left)
	- Lengths on both sides are equal where they are longer than a single bond but shorter than a double bond
 		- Can't describe the system with one structure
		- Use both $(O-O=O\leftrightarrow O=O-O)$
	- Resonance: use of > 1 structure to represent a molecule
		- Each structure is now called a resonance structure
		- Real structure is the average between the 2
			- Also called resonance hybrid
	- Resonance leads to extra stability because electrons are spread out more leading to a greater e$^-$ repulsion
	- Resonance hybrids often $\rightarrow$ partial bond orders
	- In the example is 3 bonding e$^-$ pairs/2 bonds = 1.5
	- Formal charges $\rightarrow$ resonance structure that contributes the most

# Exceptions to the octet rule (Applies mainly to 2$^nd$ period elements)
	- Electron defficient molecules
		- H-Be-H and BF$_3$
	- Odd e$^-$ molecules $\rightarrow$ free radicals (paramagnetic)
		- NO (11 electrons)
	- Expanded valance shells
		- SF$_6$ has 12 electrons around Sulfur now because it expands into the 3d orbital
