## 9.1 Intermolecular Forces

- See figs 9.2, 9.5 and table 9.3
- dipole - charge separation within a molecule
	- $_{+}\underrightarrow{H-Cl}$
- Dispersion (London)
	- common to all molecules
	- induced dipole-induced dipole
		- $N_2\dots\dots N_2$
			- When by themselves they would have circular electron cloud
		- Since there is 2+ molecules each electron cloud is distorted
- Dipole-dipole, dipole-induced dipole, and induced dipole-induced dipole - Van der Waals Forces
- > 1 can be present at the same time 
	- Ex - polar molecule molecule $H-Cl$:
		- Dispersion
		- Dipole-Dipole
		- Dipole-Induced Dipole
	- Ex - nonpolar molecule $N_2$:
		- Dispersion
- Induced Dipoles: *polarizibility* is important
	- polarizibility - how readily e$^-$ cloud can be distorted
	- Bigger atoms are more polarizable than smaller ones $\implies$ atoms left and down on the periodic table are more polarizable
	- As molar mass $\uparrow$  polarizibility $\uparrow$
	- Dispersion forces also depend on polarizibility
		- Usually $\uparrow$ with  $\uparrow$ molar mass
	- nonpolar substance, same mass: shape is important
		- elongated > more compact ones
