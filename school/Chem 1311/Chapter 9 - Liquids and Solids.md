## 9.1 Intermolecular Forces

- See figs 9.2, 9.5 and table 9.3
- dipole - charge separation within a molecule
	- $_{+}\underrightarrow{H-Cl}$
- Dispersion (London)
	- common to all molecules
	- induced dipole-induced dipole
		- $N_2\dots\dots N_2$
			- When by themselves they would have circular electron cloud
		- Since there is 2+ molecules each electron cloud is distorted
- Dipole-dipole, dipole-induced dipole, and induced dipole-induced dipole - Van der Waals Forces
- > 1 can be present at the same time 
	- Ex - polar molecule molecule $H-Cl$:
		- Dispersion
		- Dipole-Dipole
		- Dipole-Induced Dipole
	- Ex - nonpolar molecule $N_2$:
		- Dispersion
- Induced Dipoles: *polarizibility* is important
	- polarizibility - how readily e$^-$ cloud can be distorted
	- Bigger atoms are more polarizable than smaller ones $\implies$ atoms left and down on the periodic table are more polarizable
	- As molar mass $\uparrow$  polarizibility $\uparrow$
	- Dispersion forces also depend on polarizibility
		- Usually $\uparrow$ with  $\uparrow$ molar mass
	- nonpolar substance, same mass: shape is important
		- elongated > more compact ones

## The Hydrogen Bond

- Dipole-dipole interaction
- Interaction between H-atom bonded to N, O, or F with a lone pair in electronegative atom such as O, N, or F
- Ex $CH_3Br$ or $CH_3F$
	- $CH_3Br$
		- dispersion, dipole-dipole, dipole-induced dipole
		- high boiling point
		- low vapor pressure
	- $CH_3F$
		- dispersion, dipole-dipole, dipole-induced dipole
- $CH_3CH_2CH_2OH$ (propranolol) or $CH_3CH_2OCH_3$ (ethyl-methyl ether)
	- Dispersion, dipole-dipole, dipole-induced dipole
	- Propranolol has the highest bp and lowest vp

## 9.2 Properties of the liquid state

- Surface tension
	- Attractions lower E
	- Fig 9.6
	- Liquid molecules at the surface:
		- Feel a net attraction inward
		- $\implies$ liquids end towards smallest surface area (spherical shapes)
	- To $\uparrow$ surface area must break attractions to interior
		- Surface tension: E required to $\uparrow$ surface area by unit amount
		- As attractive forces $\uparrow$ surface tension $\uparrow$
- Capillarity
	- Depends on adhesion (liquid-solid) and cohesion (liquid-liquid)
		- Relative strengths dictate the shape of a liquid's meniscus
	- Ex. Glass ($SiO_2$)
		- Adhesive forces are greater than water
		- Water $\rightarrow$ concave meniscus due to stronger adhesive forces
		- $Hg\rightarrow$ convex meniscus due to stronger cohesive forcesq
