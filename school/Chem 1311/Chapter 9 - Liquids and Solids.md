## 9.1 Intermolecular Forces

- See figs 9.2, 9.5 and table 9.3
- dipole - charge separation within a molecule
	- $_{+}\underrightarrow{H-Cl}$
- Dispersion (London)
	- common to all molecules
	- induced dipole-induced dipole
		- $N_2\dots\dots N_2$
			- When by themselves they would have circular electron cloud
		- Since there is 2+ molecules each electron cloud is distorted
- Dipole-dipole, dipole-induced dipole, and induced dipole-induced dipole - Van der Waals Forces
- > 1 can be present at the same time 
	- Ex - polar molecule molecule $H-Cl$:
		- Dispersion
		- Dipole-Dipole
		- Dipole-Induced Dipole
	- Ex - nonpolar molecule $N_2$:
		- Dispersion
- Induced Dipoles: *polarizibility* is important
	- polarizibility - how readily e$^-$ cloud can be distorted
	- Bigger atoms are more polarizable than smaller ones $\implies$ atoms left and down on the periodic table are more polarizable
	- As molar mass $\uparrow$  polarizibility $\uparrow$
	- Dispersion forces also depend on polarizibility
		- Usually $\uparrow$ with  $\uparrow$ molar mass
	- nonpolar substance, same mass: shape is important
		- elongated > more compact ones

## The Hydrogen Bond

- Dipole-dipole interaction
- Interaction between H-atom bonded to N, O, or F with a lone pair in electronegative atom such as O, N, or F
- Ex $CH_3Br$ or $CH_3F$
	- $CH_3Br$
		- dispersion, dipole-dipole, dipole-induced dipole
		- high boiling point
		- low vapor pressure
	- $CH_3F$
		- dispersion, dipole-dipole, dipole-induced dipole
- $CH_3CH_2CH_2OH$ (propranolol) or $CH_3CH_2OCH_3$ (ethyl-methyl ether)
	- Dispersion, dipole-dipole, dipole-induced dipole
	- Propranolol has the highest bp and lowest vp

## 9.2 Properties of the liquid state

- Surface tension
	- Attractions lower E
	- Fig 9.6
	- Liquid molecules at the surface:
		- Feel a net attraction inward
		- $\implies$ liquids end towards smallest surface area (spherical shapes)
	- To $\uparrow$ surface area must break attractions to interior
		- Surface tension: E required to $\uparrow$ surface area by unit amount
		- As attractive forces $\uparrow$ surface tension $\uparrow$
- Capillarity
	- Depends on adhesion (liquid-solid) and cohesion (liquid-liquid)
		- Relative strengths dictate the shape of a liquid's meniscus
	- Ex. Glass ($SiO_2$)
		- Adhesive forces are greater than water
		- Water $\rightarrow$ concave meniscus due to stronger adhesive forces
		- $Hg\rightarrow$ convex meniscus due to stronger cohesive forces
- Viscosity
	- Resistance to flow in liquids
	- For flow, molecules slide across one another
		- Intermolecular attraction hampers flow ($\uparrow$ viscosity)
		- Shape is important (longer molecules $\uparrow$ viscosity)

## 9.3 Phase Transitions

- Fig 9.8 (vaporization)
- $T\uparrow\implies$ more molecules have sufficient energy
- $\Delta H_{vap}>0$ (ex. rub alcohol between your hands)
- Dynamic Equilibrium
- P exerted by vapor at equilibrium = equilibrium vapor pressure
	- or just vapor pressure of liquid at T
- Intermolecular attraction $\uparrow$
	- $\Delta H_{vap}\uparrow,\ VP\downarrow$
- VP is a function of T (fig 9.12)
- \[HI, HCl, HF]
	- lowest b.p (weaker) HCl
	- highest $\Delta H_{vap}$ (strongest) HF
	- lowest VP (strongest) HF
- For calculations of VP at different T use Clausius-Clapeyron equation (9-2)
- Normal bp - vp temp at 1 atm

## Boiling

- $P_{inside}=$VP of liq
- If VP$<P_{ext}$; bubble collapses
- If VP=$P_{ext}$; bubble rises & escapes
	- boiling point = T at which VP = $P_{ext}$
	- normal bp = bp when $P_{ext}=1\ atm$
- Attraction $\uparrow\implies\ bp\uparrow$ 

## Solid - Vapor Equilibrium

- sublimation $= s\rightarrow g$
- deposition $= g\rightarrow s$
- condensation $= g\rightarrow l$
- $\Delta H_{sub}=\Delta H_{fus}+\Delta H_{vap}$

## Phase diagram

- Gas $\implies$ high temp, low pressure
- Solid $\implies$ low temp, high pressure

## 9.4 Properties of Solids

- 2 types of solids
	- Crystalline solids: highly regular arrangement
	- Amorphous Solids: considerable disorder
- Structure of Crystalline Solids
	- Each particle lies in a specific point
		- Crystal lattice: regular pattern formed by the points
	- Fig. 9.32, 9.24
	- Unit cell: repeats itself in all 3 directions (made up of particles on specific points)
	- Types of cubic unit cells
		- Simple cubic: Particles at the vertices of a cube
		- Body centered cubic (bcc): Simple cubic with another particle at the center
		- Face centered cubic (fcc): Simple cubic with other particles at all 6 faces
	- Coordination number: \# of nearest neighbors around a particle in a crystal
		- Simple Cubic CN=6
		- BCC Cubic CN=8
		- FCC Cubic CN=12
	- atoms/unit cell (spheres/unit cell): 
		- Atoms in the center are a full atom in the unit cell
		- Atoms at vertices of a unit cell are $\frac{1}{8}$ of an atom
		- Atoms at a face of a unit cell are $\frac{1}{2}$ of an atom
		- Simple Cubic $\frac{atoms}{unit\ cell}=1$
		- BCC $\frac{atoms}{unit\ cell}=2$
		- FCC $\frac{atoms}{unit\ cell}=4$
	- In ionic compounds unit cell has the same cation/anion ration as empirical formula
- Types of Crystalline Solids 
	- Classified according to type of particles and interparticle forces
		- Ionic solids
		- Atomic solids
			- Metallic solids
			- Network solids (a.k.a Network Covalent solids)
			- Group 8A solids
		- Molecular solids
	- Fig 9.2, table 9.7, 9.11
- Packing Efficiency
	- % of space occupied by a given arrangement
	- Simple Cubic: 52%
	- BCC: 68%
	- Metals can be thought of spherical atoms packed together and bonded equally in all directions
		- Many metal (and all Group8A solids) crystallize in closest-packed structures
		- Closest Packed Structures
			- Two ways to maximize packing efficiency in 3d
			- 74% packing efficiency (figs 9.28-9.32)
	- For calculations
		- V of the unit cell in terms of radius
		- $V=d^3$ where $d=$ edge length of the cell
		- Ex fcc
			- pg 391
			- $hypotenuse=r+2r+r=4r$
			- $2d^2=(4r)^2\implies d_{fcc}=\sqrt 8r=2\sqrt 2 r$
		- $d_{bcc}=\frac{4}{\sqrt 3} r;\ d_{sc}=2r$
- Models of Metallic Bonding
	- Band theory: quantitative model of bonding in solids
		- $\psi$'s of valence e$^-$ interact with each other
		- Bonding molecular orbitals (MO) result from constructive interference
		- Anti-bonding MO's result from destructive interference
	- Band gap:
		- Metals have no band gap
		- Semiconductors have a small gap
		- Insulators have a large gap
	-
