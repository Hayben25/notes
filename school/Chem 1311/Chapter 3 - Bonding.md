Models for chemical bonding

# Background

- Why do molecules or compounds form?
	- Gilbert Lewis notice atoms react they achieve a more stable e$^-$ configuration
	- Maximum stability occurs when atom is isoelectronic (same electrons) with a noble gas
	- **Octet Rule**: atoms gain, lose or share e$^-$ to attain filled outer shell of 8 (or 2)
	- Types of chemical bonding
		- Ionic
			- complete e$^-$ transfer
		- Covalent
			- e$^-$ sharing
		- Metallic
			- e$^-$ bounce around atoms
