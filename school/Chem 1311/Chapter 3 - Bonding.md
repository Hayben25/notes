Models for chemical bonding

# Background

- Why do molecules or compounds form?
	- Gilbert Lewis notice atoms react they achieve a more stable e$^-$ configuration
	- Maximum stability occurs when atom is isoelectronic (same electrons) with a noble gas
	- **Octet Rule**: atoms gain, lose or share e$^-$ to attain filled outer shell of 8 (or 2)
	- Types of chemical bonding
		- Ionic
			- complete e$^-$ transfer
		- Covalent
			- e$^-$ sharing
		- Metallic
			- e$^-$ bounce around atoms
- Why different kinds of bonds?
	- Ionic bonding binds metal - nonmetal
	- Covalent bonding binds nonmetal - nonmetal
	- Metallic bonding binds metal - metal
	- Lewis Dot Symbols allow us to book keep where each electron is

# 3.1 - Ionic Bond

- Metal (low IE low EA) + Nonmetal (high IE high EA) $\rightarrow$ Ionic solid
- Many ionic compounds = GP1A, GP2A + halogen, O
- Study section 3.10 (naming compounds)

# 3.3 - Covalent Bond

- When 2e$^-$ shared between 2 atoms $\rightarrow$ molecules
- Used localized e$^-$ model (quantum mechanics uses e$^-$ probability)

# Lewis Structures

- Representation of covalent bonding using Lewis dot symbols
- bond order = # of e$^-$ pairs = 1
- Could draw however, Lewis dot structures don't predict geometries

# Multiple Bonds

- If electrons in a molecule don't follow the electron rule, then a second bond can be added to make it stable
- Bond length depends on atom size

# 3.4 - Electronegativity

- Ex. HCl
	- e$^-$ cloud tilted towards Cl
	- H - +$\delta$ Cl - -$\delta$
	- Called a dipole moment (vectors)
	- This example is specifically a polar bond because the cloud doesn't move entirely around Cl
- How predict polar and non-polar bonds or even ionic bonds?
	- Electronegativity is an atoms ability to attract electron density within a chemical bond
	- Different from electron affinity because EA is when it is the sole atom in it's gas state
	- Linus Pauling - devised a scale
		- Figure 3.4

# 3.5 Drawing Lewis Structures

- Usual approach:
	1. Write skeletal structure (atoms bonded to each other)
		- Put least electronegative atom in the center
			- Lowest group # then if they are the same group the higher period (lower on the table, higher refers to the period #)
		- H and F usually occupy terminal position
	2. Count total # of e$^-$ available 
	3. Draw single bonds from central atoms to surrounding ones
	4. If the octet rule not met by central atom, try double and triple bonds
