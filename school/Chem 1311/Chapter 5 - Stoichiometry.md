## Basics

- We measure stuff relative to something else
- For mass of elements measure relative to 
- Atomic mass (atomic weight) = this average mass
- Given the following isotopic masses and relative abundances of the two stable isotopes of copper
	- $^{63}_{29}Cu$ (69.09%), mass = 62.93 *amu*
	- $^{65}_{29}Cu$ (30.91%), mass = 64.9278 *amu*
	- What is the atomic mass of copper
		- (.6909)\*(62.93 *amu*)+(.3091)\*(64.9278)= 63.55 *amu*
- Mole (*mol*) $\implies$ amount of a substance containing same # of particles as there are atoms in exactly 12 grams of $^{12}C$
	- From experiment 1 *mol* = 6.022 \* 10$^{23}$ particles (Avogadro's number)
- Example: How many *mol* O atoms in 38.0 g of CO$_2$?
	- CO$_2\implies n_O=2*(\frac{g\ CO_2}{molar\ mass\ CO_2})=2*(\frac{38.0\ g\ CO_2}{44.01\ \frac{g}{mol}\ CO_2})=1.73\ mol\ of\ O\ atoms$
### Molecules
- Use *chemical formulas* to describe composition
	- Molecular formula - # of atoms of each element *actually present* in a molecule
		- E.x: NO, NH$_3$, N$_2$H$_4$ (hydrazine)(go boom), H$_2$O$_2$ (hydrogen peroxide)
	- Empirical formula - simplest whole number ration between atoms of the elements
		- E.x: NH$_2$, HO
- Molecular mass: sum of atomic masses in *amu*
	- E.x: H$_2$O
		- molecular mass = 2(1.008 *amu*)+ 16.00 *amu* = 18.02 *amu*
		- Molar mass = 18.02 $\frac{g}{mol}$

## Experimental Determination of Atomic and Molecular Masses

- Best method is mass spectrometer - see fig 5.1
- Use to determine percent composition of compounds
	- Mass % of each element contained in the compound
- E.x How determine if a sample of H$_2$O$_2$ is pure?
- Expect (for pure compound)
	- mass % of H = 5.926%
	- mass % of O = 94.06%
	- If measure other %'s $\implies$ not pure
	- Note: Empirical formula HO $\rightarrow$ same result
