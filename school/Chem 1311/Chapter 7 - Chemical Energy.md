## Thermochemistry

- Study of heat (thermal energy) changes in chemical reactions
- Subbranch of thermodynamics
- Only first law (Hooray)
- Universe = System + surroundings
	- System - specific part of universe of interest
	- Surroundings - the rest of the universe
- E.x. Combustion of $H_2(g)$
	- $2H_2(g)+O_2(g)\rightarrow 2H_2O(l)+energy$
	- Reaction is the system
	- Everything else is the surroundings
	- Energy released - exothermic
- E.x. At high T's:
	- $energy + 2HgO(s)\rightarrow 2Hg(l) + O_2(g)$
	- Energy gained from surroundings
	- Endothermic reaction

## Forms of Energy Transfer

- Heat - Thermal energy ($q$) \[$T_1>T_2\implies$ heat flows $T_1\rightarrow T_2$]
- Work - energy transferred when an object is moved by a force
	- E.x. Moving a piston when a gas expands
		- Pressure volume work
		- $W=-P\Delta V=-P(V_f-V_i)$
## 1$^{st}$ Law of Thermodynamics

- $\Delta U=q+w$
	- $\Delta U$ is internal energy, also called $\Delta E$
	- $\implies$ principle of conservation of energy
		- Energy is not created or destroyed, it is transferred to and from the surroundings
	- $q>0$ (+)  $\rightarrow$ head absorbed
	- $q<0$ (-)  $\rightarrow$ head released
	- $w>0$ (+)  $\rightarrow$ work done on the system
	- $w<0$ (-)  $\rightarrow$ work done by the system ($w=-P(V_f-V_i)<0$)
- Energy Units
	- $1\ J(Joule)=1\ kg*m^2/s^2$
	- $101.3\ J = 1\ L*atm$
	- $1\ cal=4.184\ J$ modern definition
		- Chemical reactions use kJ, kcal
	- Nutritional Calorie $(C)=1\ kcal$

## State Functions

- Changes depend **only** on state of the system, **not** on how it got there
- State functions: U, P, T, V
- $q$ and $w$ **in general** are not state functions = forms of energy transfer $\implies$ depend on the path
- Frequently carry out experiments in an open vessel (constant P)
	- Therefore new function
		- Enthalpy: $\Delta H=q_P$

## 7.1 Enthalpy

- $H\define U+PV$ - state function
- $\Delta H =\Delta U+P\Delta V=q+w+P\Delta V=q-P\Delta V+P\Delta V=q$
- $\Delta H$ refers to the transfer of heat
- For many reactions $\Delta H\approx\Delta U$ (but not always)

## Some types of $\Delta H$

- Heat of Combustion ($\Delta H_{comb}$)- 1 mol of substance combines with $O_2$
- Heat of Formation ($\Delta H_f$) - 1 mol of compound produced from its elements
	- $K(s)+ \frac{1}{2}Br_2(l)\rightarrow KBr(s)\ \Delta H=\Delta H_f$
- Heat of Fusion ($\Delta H_{fus}$) - 1 mol of substance melted
	- $H_2O(s)\rightarrow H_2O(l)$
- Heat of Vaporization ($\Delta H_{vap}$) - 1 mol of substance vaporized
	- $H_2O(l)\rightarrow H_2O(g)$

- How to measure heat changes?

## 7.2 Calorimetry

- Heat Capacity ($C$) - Amount of heat required for sample $\Delta T=1K$ $C=\frac{q}{\Delta T}$ (extensive)
- Specific Heat ($s$) - Amount of heat needed to change T of 1 g by 1K $s=\frac{C}{m}$ (intensive)
- Looking at both equations we find $q=ms\Delta T$ and $q=C\Delta T$
- $H_2O$: $s=4.184\ J/(g*K)$ 
	- Heat capacity of 60 g of $H_2O$
		- $C=60\ g*4.184=251\ J/K$
	- Molar heat capacity: $J/(mol*K)$
		- $H_2O=75.40\ J/(mol*K)$
- Ex. $486\ g\ H_2O$ is heated from $8.50\degree C\rightarrow 74.6\degree C$. What is the heat absorbed?
	- $q=ms\Delta T=(486\ g)*(4.184\ J/(g*K))*(66.1K)=134*10^3\ J=134\ kJ$
	- How measure?
- Constant V Calorimetry
	- Use bomb calorimeter (see Fig 7.6)
	- $q_{sample}=-q_{calorimeter}=-(q_{bomb}+q_{water})$ Therefore,
		- $q_{sample}=-(calorimeter\ heat\ capacity)*(\Delta T)$
- What is the heat capacity of the calorimeter used if $0.8650\ g$ of graphite releases $393.5\ kJ/mol$ & $\Delta T=2.613K$
	- $q=C\Delta T$ $C=\frac{q}{\Delta T}$ $q_{calorimeter}=-q_{sample}$
