## Thermochemistry

- Study of heat (thermal energy) changes in chemical reactions
- Subbranch of thermodynamics
- Only first law (Hooray)
- Universe = System + surroundings
	- System - specific part of universe of interest
	- Surroundings - the rest of the universe
- E.x. Combustion of $H_2(g)$
	- $2H_2(g)+O_2(g)\rightarrow 2H_2O(l)+energy$
	- Reaction is the system
	- Everything else is the surroundings
	- Energy released - exothermic
- E.x. At high T's:
	- $energy + 2HgO(s)\rightarrow 2Hg(l) + O_2(g)$
	- Energy gained from surroundings
	- Endothermic reaction

## Forms of Energy Transfer

- Heat - Thermal energy ($q$) \[$T_1>T_2\implies$ heat flows $T_1\rightarrow T_2$]
- Work - energy transferred when an object is moved by a force
	- E.x. Moving a piston when a gas expands
		- Pressure volume work
		- $W=-P\Delta V=-P(V_f-V_i)$
## 1$^{st}$ Law of Thermodynamics

- $\Delta U=q+w$
	- $\Delta U$ is internal energy, also called $\Delta E$
	- $\implies$ principle of conservation of energy
		- Energy is not created or destroyed, it is transferred to and from the surroundings
	- $q>0$ (+)  $\rightarrow$ head absorbed
	- $q<0$ (-)  $\rightarrow$ head released
	- $w>0$ (+)  $\rightarrow$ work done on the system
	- $w<0$ (-)  $\rightarrow$ work done by the system ($w=-P(V_f-V_i)<0$)
- Energy Units
	- $1\ J(Joule)=1\ kg*m^2/s^2$
	- $101.3\ J = 1\ L*atm$
	- $1\ cal=4.184\ J$ modern definition
		- Chemical reactions use kJ, kcal
	- Nutritional Calorie $(C)=1\ kcal$
