- 2.1 Classical Picture  
  - Everything treated as particles  
- 2.2 From classical physics to quantum mechanics  
  - Started in 1900 with Max Planck  
    - Quantum theory was developed (turned physics upside down)  
# Wave properties  

  - Electromagnetic waves (light waves)  
    - Has electric and magnetic fields (current)  
    - Emission of energy in the form of waves (e.x visible light)  
      - Like Fig 2.1  
    - Oscillating electric and magnetic fields  
      - Magnetic is perpendicular and in phase to electric field  
      - Shorter wavelength$\implies$higher frequency  
      - Speed of the wave \= $\frac{distance}{wave}*\frac{waves}{time}=\frac{distance}{time}$  
      - c = speed of light = $3.00*10^8 \frac{m}{s}$  
      - c = $\lambda$v or v = $\frac{c}{\lambda}$
        - $\lambda$ = frequency  
      - Radiant energy can be emitted over broad range of â€™s electromagnetic spectrum (see figure 2.2)
      - Monochromatic light - light of a single $\lambda$ 
      - poly-chromatic light - many $\lambda$'s (white light)
      - Example:
	      - The $\lambda$ of the green light of the traffic signal is centered at 522 nm. What is the frequency?
		      - v = $\frac{c}{\lambda}$
		      - 1 nm = $10^{-9}$ m
		      - $\frac{3*10^{8}m/s}{522*10^{-9}m}=5.75*10^{14} Hz$
# Plank's Quantum Hypothesis

- Blackbody radiation - emitted by a body at a given T
	- Ex. Red glow of oven coils
- Proposed atoms and molecules emit (or absorb) E in discrete quantities (not continuously)
	- quantum = smallest E increment that can be emitted or absorbed
	- For one quantum: $E=h\nu$
		- h (Planck's constant) = $6.626*10^{-34}J*s$
	- In general: $E=nh\nu$ = quantum number
		- n is a positive integer
- Explained experimental data <ins>but why was energy quantized</ins>?

# 2.3 The Photoelectric Effect

- Need a minimum (threshold) frequency (not intensity) to emit e$^-$
- Unexplainable by wave nature of light
- (1905) Einstein used Planck's theory to solve mystery
- Extraordinary assumption: think of beam of light as stream of particles [photons] (not as wavelike)
	- Deduced $E_{photon}=h\nu$($\nu=$ frequency of light)
- If $E_{photon} \gt e^-$ binding energy (BE) $\implies e^-$ breaks free
- If $E_{photon} < BE$ $\implies$ no e$^-$ regardless of intensity
- Einstein's work paved the way for solving another mystery
	- Emission spectra of atoms
	- See Fig. 2.6 & 2.7

# 2.4 Bohr's Model of the H Atom

- Bohr offered theoretical explanation (1913)
- By then knew that electrons orbited the nucleus
- Bohr proposed severe restriction; only certain orbits (stationary states) are allowed
	- Each orbit has a particular E $\implies$ E of e$^-$ motion is quantized
