- 2.1 Classical Picture  
  - Everything treated as particles  
- 2.2 From classical physics to quantum mechanics  
  - Started in 1900 with Max Planck  
    - Quantum theory was developed (turned physics upside down)  
- Wave properties  
  - Electromagnetic waves (light waves)  
    - Has electric and magnetic fields (current)  
    - Emission of energy in the form of waves (e.x visible light)  
      - Like Fig 2.1  
    - Oscillating electric and magnetic fields  
      - Magnetic is perpendicular and in phase to electric field  
      - Shorter wavelength$\implies$higher frequency  
      - Speed of the wave \= $\frac{distance}{wave}*\frac{waves}{time}=\frac{distance}{time}$  
      - c \= speed of light \= $3.00*108 \frac{m}{s}$  
      - c = $\lambda$v or v = $\frac{c}{\lambda}$
        - $\lambda$ = frequency  
      - Radiant energy can be emitted over broad range of â€™s electromagnetic spectrum (see figure 2.2)
