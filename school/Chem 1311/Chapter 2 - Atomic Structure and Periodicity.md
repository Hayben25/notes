- 2.1 Classical Picture  
  - Everything treated as particles  
- 2.2 From classical physics to quantum mechanics  
  - Started in 1900 with Max Planck  
    - Quantum theory was developed (turned physics upside down)  
# Wave properties  

  - Electromagnetic waves (light waves)  
    - Has electric and magnetic fields (current)  
    - Emission of energy in the form of waves (e.x visible light)  
      - Like Fig 2.1  
    - Oscillating electric and magnetic fields  
      - Magnetic is perpendicular and in phase to electric field  
      - Shorter wavelength$\implies$higher frequency  
      - Speed of the wave \= $\frac{distance}{wave}*\frac{waves}{time}=\frac{distance}{time}$  
      - c = speed of light = $3.00*10^8 \frac{m}{s}$  
      - c = $\lambda$v or v = $\frac{c}{\lambda}$
        - $\lambda$ = frequency  
      - Radiant energy can be emitted over broad range of â€™s electromagnetic spectrum (see figure 2.2)
      - Monochromatic light - light of a single $\lambda$ 
      - poly-chromatic light - many $\lambda$'s (white light)
      - Example:
	      - The $\lambda$ of the green light of the traffic signal is centered at 522 nm. What is the frequency?
		      - v = $\frac{c}{\lambda}$
		      - 1 nm = $10^{-9}$ m
		      - $\frac{3*10^{8}m/s}{522*10^{-9}m}=5.75*10^{14} Hz$
# Plank's Quantum Hypothesis

- Blackbody radiation - emitted by a body at a given T
	- Ex. Red glow of oven coils
- Proposed atoms and molecules emit (or absorb) E in discrete quantities (not continuously)
	- quantum = smallest E increment that can be emitted or absorbed
	- For one quantum: $E=h\nu$
		- h (Planck's constant) = $6.626*10^{-34}J*s$
	- In general: $E=nh\nu$ = quantum number
		- n is a positive integer
- Explained experimental data <ins>but why was energy quantized</ins>?

# 2.3 The Photoelectric Effect

- Need a minimum (threshold) frequency (not intensity) to emit e$^-$
- Unexplainable by wave nature of light
- (1905) Einstein used Planck's theory to solve mystery
- Extraordinary assumption: think of beam of light as stream of particles [photons] (not as wavelike)
	- Deduced $E_{photon}=h\nu$($\nu=$ frequency of light)
- If $E_{photon} \gt e^-$ binding energy (BE) $\implies e^-$ breaks free
- If $E_{photon} < BE$ $\implies$ no e$^-$ regardless of intensity
- Einstein's work paved the way for solving another mystery
	- Emission spectra of atoms
	- See Fig. 2.6 & 2.7

# 2.4 Bohr's Model of the H Atom

- Bohr offered theoretical explanation (1913)
- By then knew that electrons orbited the nucleus
- Bohr proposed severe restriction; only certain orbits (stationary states) are allowed
	- Each orbit has a particular E $\implies$ E of e$^-$ motion is quantized
- Showed that for an H atom
	- $E_n=-R_H(\frac{1}{n^2})$
	- $R_H=2.18*10^{-18}$ J Rydberg constant
	- $n$ must be a positive int (principle quantum #)
		- Ground state is when $n=1$ (lowest E state)
		- Excited states are when $n \gt 1$
	- Radius $\alpha$ $n^2$
- Figure 2.8
- Spectrum: $n_i\implies n_f$ 
	- $\Delta E=[R_H(\frac{1}{n_f^2}]-[R_H(\frac{1}{n_i^2}]=R_H(\frac{1}{n_i^2}-\frac{1}{n_f^2})$ - Rydberg equation
	- Since photon energy, $E_{photon}=h\nu$, is emitted
	- $\Delta E=h\nu=R_H(\frac{1}{n_i^2}-\frac{1}{n_f^2})$
- Example. What is $\lambda$ of photon for $n_i=5\implies n_f=2$ transition of H-atom
	- $\Delta E = R_H(\frac{1}{n_i^2}-\frac{1}{n_f^2})=2.18*10^{-18}(\frac{1}{25}-\frac{1}{4})=-4.58*10^{-19}J$ 
	- $\lambda=\frac{c}{\nu}=\frac{c}{|\Delta E|/h}=4.34*10^{-7}(10^9nm)=434nm$
- Other approach
	- $\Delta E=h\nu=\frac{hc}{\lambda}\implies R_H^{(J)}(\frac{1}{n_i^2}-\frac{1}{n_f^2})/hc=\frac{1}{\lambda})$
	- $\frac{1}{\lambda}=R_H|\frac{1}{n_i^2}-\frac{1}{n_f^2}|=\frac{1}{\lambda}$
	- new $R_H=1.09678*10^{7}m^{-1}$

# Spectacular Success of Bohr's Model Followed By Series of Disappointments

- Only worked for $H,He^+,Li^{2+},...$ (One electron atoms)
- Don't know where electrons are because particles are waves as well

# 2.6 Quantum Mechanics

- Heisenberg uncertainty principle - it is impossible to know simultaneously both the momentum (p) and the position (x) of a particle with certainty
	- $\Delta x \Delta p \ge h/4\pi$, $\Delta p = m\Delta u$
- Application to H (problem 67) $\rightarrow e^-$ does not orbit nucleus in a well defined path as Bohr though
- 1926 Erwin Schrodinger derived equation $\rightarrow$ new era in chemistry and physics
	- Modern quantum mechanics or wave mechanics
	- System described by wavefunction: $\psi$ (psi)
	- Obeys Schrodinger equation: $\hat{H}\psi=E\psi$
		- States of the system
	- $\psi^2\rightarrow$ probability of finding system (electron) at that point
		- Plot it $\rightarrow$ probability distribution = electron density map
			- Like Fig. 2.11, 2.12
- Atomic orbital (not orbit) = $\psi$ of $e^-$ in an atom
	- Described by the geometric picture of $\psi^2$ 
- Schrodinger equation $\rightarrow$ need 3 quantum numbers to describe orbital (n,$l$,$m_l$)

# 2.7 Quantum Numbers

- Principal quantum number (*n*)
	- n = 1,2,3 ... as in Rydberg equation
	- H - atom: n $\rightarrow$ energy of the orbital
	- Relates. avg. distance from nucleus
		- ($\rightarrow$ relative orbital size)
	- Each *n*=shell(level)
- Angular momentum quantum number ($l$)
	- $\rightarrow$ shape of the orbital
	- $l=0\rightarrow n-1$($n=3\implies l=0,1,2$: three subshells)
<table>
<tr><td>l</td><td>0</td><td>1</td><td>2</td><td>3</td></tr>
<tr><td>letter</td><td>s</td><td>p</td><td>d</td><td>f</td></tr>
</table>
- Magnetic quantum number ($m_l$)
	- $\rightarrow$ number of orbitals in each subshell
		- $m_l=-l,(l+1),..0..(l-1),l$
		- 2l+1 values (# of orbitals in subshell)
		- ($l = 2 \implies m_l = -2,-1,0,1,2$)
- Ex. n=2, l=1 $\rightarrow$ 2p subshell; in subshell have 3 2p orbitals ($m_l=-1,0,1$)(x,y,z)
	- Total # of orbitals = $n^2$
		- (n = 2: one s and 3 p orbitals = 4)
- Ex Give the values of the quantum number in the 4d and 3p subshells
	- 4d (n=4, l=2) $m_l=-2,-1,0,1,2$
	- 3p (n=3, l=1) $m_l=-1,0,1$

# 2.8 Atomic Orbitals

- What are shapes and extent of orbitals?
	- See Figs. 2.13-2.18
- Many $e^-$ atoms
	- Schrodinger equation difficult impossible to solve exactly for many atoms
		- Approximate: use H-atom orbitals whose energies are modified by new interactions
- n(size only for multiple $e^-$ atoms), l, $m_l$ describe orbital
	- An additional quantum number to describe $e^-$
	- Electron spin quantum # ($m_s$)
- Electron spin quantum #
	- $e^-$ acts as if spinning about axis
	- Spin up $m_s=+\frac{1}{2}$
	- Spin down $m_s=-\frac{1}{2}$

# 2.9 Electron Configuration

- Each $e^-$ is completely described by 4 quantum numbers:
	- n,l,$m_l$ for orbital
	- $m_s$ for spin
- Pauli exclusion principle
	- No 2 electrons can have the same set of the 4 quantum numbers
- Electrostatic effects
	- $e^- \rightarrow$ nucleus (attractive)
	- $e^- \rightarrow e^-$ (repulsive)
	- nuclear charge varies indirectly with orbital energy (H, He$^+$ have different energies but same electrons because the charge on an He nucleus is higher than H)
	- Shielding of nuclear charge:
		- Closer electrons block full nuclear charge from farther electrons
		- Think shell law but with electrons instead of shells
		- $e^-$ in different orbitals - inner $e^-$ shield outer ones from nuclear charge
	- Orbital E goes $s\lt p\lt d\lt f$
		- See figure 2.20
		- Therefore, orbitals are split in energy according to E
			- Like Fig 2.18, 2.22
- Ground state $e^-$ configuration
	- Add $e^-$ of each subsequent element to lowest E orbital available (Afbau principle: "build up")
	- Orbitals stray from their original energy levels due to their multitude of electrons deflecting each other
- Hund's Rule
	- When orbitals have same E, the most stable arrangement has the greatest # of parallel spins
		- pg 82
- Chromium and Copper take an electron from 4s orbital and add it to the 3d subshell
- Valence shell - highest n (outermost shell)
	- Valence $e^-$ are the ones in the valence shell
- Core $e^-$ - lower E level
- $e^-$ configuration of S, Hg, Pd
	- Sulfur - [Ne]3s$^2$ 3p$^4$
	- Mercury - [Xe]6s$^2$ 4f$^{14}$ 5d$^{10}$ 
	- Palladium - [Kr] 4d$^{10}$
- Ions Produced (Main Gp)
	- Tendency: obtain filled outer level (noble gas configuration)
	- 3A, 4A, & 5A groups lose their s & p orbitals to become more stable

# 2.10 Physical Properties

- Atomic size:
	- Increases opposite the charge of atom along a period and increases as the period increases
	- Transition elements the trend is not as dramatic
- Ionic radius:
	- affects properties of ionic compounds [we]
