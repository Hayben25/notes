## 8.1 Pressure of Gas

- Gas molecules in motion and exert a force on surface in contact with
- Vacuum doesn't pull, pressure pushes

## Atmospheric Pressure

- Force on any area due to atmosphere = weight of air column above it
- Pressure = force/area
- Atmospheric pressure = pressure from the column of air
- Can measure with a barometer
	- See Fig 8.2
- Standard Atmospheric Pressure (1 atm)
	-  The pressure that supports a column of Hg exactly 760 mm high at 0$\degree$C at sea level
	- 1 torr = 1 mm Hg $\implies$ 1 atm = 760 mm Hg =760 torr

## 8.2 The Gas Laws

- P-V Relationships: Boyle's Law
	- Used a manometer to measure pressure
	- Found that graph of V vs. $\frac{1}{P}$ is a straight line
	- PV=constant
- T-V Relationship: Charle's Law
	- See Fig. 8.9
	- Always extrapolate to -273.15$\degree$C to be a zero for any P, n
	- V $\propto$ T or $\frac{V}{T}$=const; V=const\*T
	- Identify absolute zero (T for V=0; unattainable)
- Volume - Amount Relationship: Avogadro's Law
	- At T, P const: V $\propto$ n (n$\uparrow\ \rightarrow$   V$\uparrow$)

## 8.3 Ideal Gas Equation

| Boyle's Law    | $V\propto\frac{1}{P}$ | n, T const |
| -------------- | --------------------- | ---------- |
| Charle's Law   | $V\propto T$          | n, P const |
| Avogadro's Law | $V\propto n$          | P, T const |
- $\implies V\propto nT/P$
- Proportionality constant is the gas constant R
- $V=R\frac{nT}{P}$ or $PV=nRT$  (Must have temperature in K)
- 2 assumption for ideal gas
	- Molecules to not attract or repel each other
	- Molecules don't have volume
- Real gases behave like ideal gases under reasonable conditions $\implies$ can use equation
- From experiment At 0$\degree$C, P = 1 atm, find 1 mol $\rightarrow$ V=22.414L
- Therefore, $$R=\frac{PV}{nT}=\frac{(1 atm)(22.414L)}{(1mol)(273.15K)}=0.082057\frac{L*atm}{K*mol}$$

## Standard Conditions

- Standard temperature and pressure (STP)
- $T=0\degree C$, $P=1\ atm$
- What is the standard molar volume? 22.414L
