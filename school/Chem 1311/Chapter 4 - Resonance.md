## 5 Basic Molecular Shapes

- Linear
	- 180$\degree$
- Trigonal planar
	- 120$\degree$ 
- Tetrahedral
	- 109.5$\degree$
- Trigonal bi-pyramidal
	- 90$\degree$ 120$\degree$
- Octahedral
	- 90$\degree$
- Approach
	- Write a Lewis structure. Consider only e$^-$ groups around central atom
	- Count # of e$^-$ groups around central atom
		- bonding + lone pairs
		- treat double, triple bonds as single bonds
	- Use table 4.1 - 4.3 to predict structure
	- For bond angles
		- Repulsion
			- lone pair - lone pair > lone pair - bonding pair > bonding pair - bonding pair
	- If > 1 resonance structure can apply VSEPR to any of them
- Examples
	- AX$_n$ A - central atom, n = 2 to 6
		- Geometries:
			- Linear 180$\degree$ for n = 2
			- Trigonal planar 120$\degree$ for n = 3
			- Tetrahedral 109.5$\degree$ for n = 4
			- Trigonal bi-pyramidal 90$\degree$ 120$\degree$ n = 5
			- Octahedral 90$\degree$ n = 6
	- Central Atom w/ $\ge$ 1 lone pair AX$_n$E$_m$
		- **Important**
			- Geometry determined only by the arrangement of nuclei (not lone pairs)
		- AX$_2$E
			- Electron group arrangement: Trigonal planar
			- Geometry is bent (angular, v shaped)
			- But, as in book: assume no distortion for angles $\ge$ 120
		- AX$_3$E
			- Tetrahedral for electron group arrangement
			- But geometry is trigonal pyramidal $\le$ 109.5
		- AX$_2$E$_2$
			- Tetrahedral e$^-$ group arrangement
			- Bent geometry $\le$ 109.5
		- AX$_4$E
			- Trigonal bi-pyramidal e$^-$ groups
			- Lone pair goes at the equatorial position because angle at equatorial position is 120$\degree$ is bigger then the 90$\degree$ at axial
- Effect of double bond
