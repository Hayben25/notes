## 5 Basic Molecular Shapes

- Linear
	- 180$\degree$
- Trigonal planar
	- 120$\degree$ 
- Tetrahedral
	- 109.5$\degree$
- Trigonal bi-pyramidal
	- 90$\degree$ 120$\degree$
- Octahedral
	- 90$\degree$
- Approach
	- Write a Lewis structure. Consider only e$^-$ groups around central atom
	- Count # of e$^-$ groups around central atom
		- bonding + lone pairs
		- treat double, triple bonds as single bonds
	- Use table 4.1 - 4.3 to predict structure
	- For bond angles
		- Repulsion
			- lone pair - lone pair > lone pair - bonding pair > bonding pair - bonding pair
	- If > 1 resonance structure can apply VSEPR to any of them
- Examples
	- AX$_n$ A - central atom, n = 2 to 6
		- Geometries:
			- Linear 180$\degree$ for n = 2
			- Trigonal planar 120$\degree$ for n = 3
			- Tetrahedral 109.5$\degree$ for n = 4
			- Trigonal bi-pyramidal 90$\degree$ 120$\degree$ n = 5
			- Octahedral 90$\degree$ n = 6
	- Central Atom w/ $\ge$ 1 lone pair AX$_n$E$_m$
		- **Important**
			- Geometry determined only by the arrangement of nuclei (not lone pairs)
		- AX$_2$E
			- Electron group arrangement: Trigonal planar
			- Geometry is bent (angular, v shaped)
			- But, as in book: assume no distortion for angles $\ge$ 120
		- AX$_3$E
			- Tetrahedral for electron group arrangement
			- But geometry is trigonal pyramidal $\le$ 109.5
		- AX$_2$E$_2$
			- Tetrahedral e$^-$ group arrangement
			- Bent geometry $\le$ 109.5
		- AX$_4$E
			- Trigonal bi-pyramidal e$^-$ groups
			- Lone pair goes at the equatorial position because angle at equatorial position is 120$\degree$ is bigger then the 90$\degree$ at axial
			- Geometry is distorted tetrahedron or seesaw (Table 4.3)
				- See fig. 4.6b for others
- Effect of double bond
	- Repels more

## 4.2 Dipole Moments

- Recall H$--$Cl
	-       $\delta$+    $\delta$ -
	- Which makes a polar bond
		- Makes a dipole moment
- Dipole moment ($\mu$) - quantitative measure of polarity
	- $\mu = \delta * d$
		- $\delta=$ magnitude of charge
		- $d=$ charge separation
		- $\mu \gt 0$
		- Units = debye (D); $1D=3.33*10^{-30} C*m$ 
		- Direction of moment has direction of negative dipole
- Ex. CO$_2$ (triatomic)
	- Possible shapes are linear or bent
	- If linear, the 2 C-O bonds cancel out making $\mu=0$
	- If bent, the 2 C-O bonds don't cancel out making $\mu \ne 0$
	- Linear molecule is correct
- Comparing NH$_3$ and NF$_3$
	- NH$_3$ has $\mu=1.47D$ 
	- NF$_3$ has $\mu=0.24D$
	- This is because the dipole moment goes away from hydrogen and towards Florine 

## 4.3 Theories of Covalent Bonding

- Quantum Mechanics has 2 main theories
	- Valence Bond Theory
	- Molecular Orbital Theory

## 4.4 Valence Bond Theory

- There is a difference in bonds depending on the level of atoms bonded
- Take CH$_4$
	- Since Carbon has 2 electrons in its outermost shell can we only make CH$_2$?(No)
	- e$^-$ promote to the last 2p orbital making 4 lone electrons on Carbon
		- This is the wrong shape though because the 2p orbital has 90$\degree$ between its electrons
	- Hybridization is the answer - Mixing of atomic orbitals in an atom $\rightarrow$ hybrid orbitals
	- Combine 2s + 3 2p $\rightarrow$ 4 sp$^3$
	- See fig 4.15,4.17-4.20, 4.26
- Approach - Lewis + VSEPR $\rightarrow$ shape $\rightarrow$ to explain hybridization
	- \# of hybrid orbitals = \# of atomic orbitals used
- s,p,d hybridization
	- SF$_6$
		- octahedral
		- sp$^3$d$^2$
		- See fig 4.36

## Molecular bond theory

- All electrons must be calculated
- For each bond you can either add (e.x $\sigma_{1s}$) also called bonding or subtract (e.x $\sigma^*_{1s}$) also called anti bonding
- Bond order = $\frac{1}{2}$(# of e$^-$ bonding - # of e$^-$ anti-bonding)
	- BO = $\frac{1}{2}$ stable (weakly)
	- BO = 1 stable
	- BO = 0 unstable
	- If BO is a whole number then it's diamagnetic, otherwise it's diamagnetic
	- Only count the open shell to calculate bond order to go faster (because in a closed bond they both cancel)
- For each new orbital draw another structure (e.x Li$_2$ has 2 drawings, for 1s and 2s each)
- p 186 shows p orbitals
	- Only one orbital has $\sigma$ bonds, all others have $\pi$
	- Expect $\sigma_{2p}$ to be more stable that $\pi_{2s}$
		- BUT: $\sigma_{2p}$ occupies the same spaces as $\sigma_{2s} \implies$ e$^-$ - e$^-$ repulsion destabilizes $\sigma_{2p}$ (effect depends on $\Delta E$)
		- Pairing up e$^-$ the increases the $\Delta$E separation between the 2s and 2p orbitals
			- If there is < 6 valence e$^-$ then the energy order is $2\pi_{2p}<\sigma_{2p}<2\pi^*_{2p}<\sigma^*_{2p}$
				- Otherwise $\sigma_{2p}<2\pi_{2p}<2\pi^*_{2p}<\sigma^*_{2p}$ (the first 2 switch)
- Determine MO diagrams bond order magnetic properties O$_2$, O$_2^+$, and B$_2$
	- O$_2$
		- 2s bond is filled 
		- $\sigma_{2p}$ and $\pi_{2p}$ are filled, only $\frac{1}{2}$ of the 2$\pi_{2p}^*$ is filled
		- BO = 2
		- Paramagnetic
	- O$_2^+$
		- Same as O$_2$ but there is only 1 electron in $\pi^*_{2p}$ bond
		- BO = $\frac{5}{2}$
		- Paramagnetic
	- B$_2$
		- 2s bond is filled
		- Only $\frac{1}{2}$ of $\pi_{2p}$ is filled
		- BO = 1
		- Paramagnetic
