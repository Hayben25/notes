## Major Classes

- Precipitation Reactions$\rightarrow$Generate an insoluble product (precipitate)
- Acid-Base Reaction$\rightarrow$Reactions that involve proton transfer (H$^+$ is a proton)
- Redox (reduction oxidation)$\rightarrow e^-$ transfer

## 6.1 Properties of Aqueous Solutions

- See Fig. 6.2, 6.4
- Electrolytes
	- When dissolved in H$_2$O conducts electricity
	- $NaCl(s)\ \underrightarrow{H_2O}\ Na^+(aq)+Cl^-(aq)$
		- Strong electrolyte $\implies$ good conductor of electricity, Why? Dissociates completely
- Nonelectrolytes
	- Do not conduct electricity

## 6.1.1 Solution Stoichiometry

- Concentration of solutions - amount of solute in a given volume of solution
- Molarity (M) or molar concentration - common unit
	- $M=\frac{n_{solute}}{V_{solution}\ (L)}$ or $M=\frac{moles\ of\ solute}{L\ of\ solution}$
- Ex. 500 ml containing 0.730 mol glucose
	- Molar concentration?
		- $M=\frac{0.730\ mol}{0.500\ L}=1.46\ m/L=1.46\ M\implies$ don't actually need 1 L
- M refers to what is originally dissolved $\implies$ does not take into account subsequent processes
	- Ex. $Ba(NO_3)_2\ (s)\rightarrow Ba^{2+}\ (aq)+2NO_3^-\ (aq)$ in $H_2O$
		- 1 M barium nitrate solution
			- $\implies [Ba^{2+}]=1M$  and $[NO_3^-]=2M$
				- $[\dots]$ - concentration
	- Ex. How many grams of $Na_2SO_4$ are needed to prepare 250 ml of a 0.683 M solution
		- n=MV
		- $n_{Na_2So_4}=V*M= (0.250\ L)*(0.683\ M\ Na_2SO_4)=0.171\ mol\ Na_2SO_4$
		- $g\ Na_2SO_4=0.171\ mol * 142.1\ g/mol=24.3\ g$
- Dilution of Solutions
	- Common to have a *stock solution*
		- Concentrated solution that can be diluted to the concentration desired
	- Dilution - adding solvent to decrease the concentration
		- $n_{solute}$ before dilution $=n_{solute}$ after dilution
			- $n_{solute}=M*V$
		- $M_{initial}*V_{initial}=M_{final}*V_{final}$
	- Ex. How prepare $5.00 * 10^2\ ml$ of a 1.75 M $HNO_3$ solution from 8.61 M stock solution of $HNO_3$
		- $M_{final}=1.75\ M$, $M_{initial}=8.61\ M$, $V_{final}=0.500\ L$
		- $M_{initial}*V_{initial}=M_{final}*V_{final}\implies V_{initial}=\frac{M_{final}*V_{final}}{M_{initial}}=\frac{1.75\ M* .5\ L}{8.61\ M}=1.02\ L$
	- Can carry out stoichiometric calculations
		- What volume of 1.50 M $Pb(CH_3COO)_2$ contains .4 mol Pb$^+$?
		- How many grams of solid PbCl$_2$ forms when this volume reacts with 125 ml of 3.4 M NaCl
