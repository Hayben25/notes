- Matter is anything that occupies space and has mass  
- 1.1 Atomic theory \- early ideas  
  - Democritus (460-370 BC) \- Greek philosopher  
    - Introduced notion of atomism  
    - Matter is composed of small, invisible particles called atoms  
    - Not believed by people like Plato, Aristotle  
      - Idea suppressed for \~2000 years  
  - John Daltonâ€™s Atomic Theory  
    - Began modern era of chemistry  
    - Theory (read these)  
      - All matter is composed of extremely small indestructible atoms  
      - All atoms of a given element are identical, but atoms of one element differ from those of another element  
      - Compounds are composed of more than one element united in fixed proportions  
      - Chemical reactions only separate, combine or rearrange atoms. They do not create or destroy them (Rejected alchemy)  
  - Mass laws:  
    - Law of definite (constant) composition  
      - All samples of a compound have the same composition regardless of its source  
        - i.e same fraction by mass of each element present (see postulate 2 and 3\)  
        - Mass fraction \= total mass of an element in a compound/ mass of a compound   
          - I.e $H_2O$ has a total mass of 18 amu, since hydrogen is 1 amu the mass of hydrogen in water will always be \~.11 of the compound  
      - Sample problem  
        - 84.2 g of pitchblend contains 71.4 g of uranium, how many g of uranium can be obtained from 102 kg of pitchblend  
          - $\frac{x}{102} = \frac{71.4}{84.2}  x = 86.5$ kg or $86.5*\mathrm{10}^3$ g  
            - Mass fraction is found from dividing the 71.4 g of uranium by the 84.2 g of pitchblend to find the mass fraction  
            - Using the mass fraction of pitchblend multiple by 102 kg to find the mass of the uranium in the 102 kg sample of pitchblend   
    - Law of multiple proportions  
      - Say you can form many compounds from the same 2 elements and that one of the masses of either of the elements in all compounds  
        - The masses of the other element in the compounds will occur in the ratio of small whole numbers (postulates 2 & 3\)  
      - e.x Carbon and oxygen  
        - Carbon monoxide  
        - Carbon dioxide  
        - If the mass of carbon is fixed then mass of O in carbon dioxide/ mass of O in carbon monoxide \= 2  
    - Law of mass conservation  
      - Matter cannot be created or destroyed (postulate 4\)  
      - Reactants $\rightarrow$ products  
        - Mass of reactants \= mass of products  
  - Limitations of Dalton's model  
    - Discovered subatomic particles  
      - Atom = $\mathrm{e}^-$ + nucleus  
      - Nucleus \= $\mathrm{p}^+$+n  
        - $\mathrm{p}^+$ mass = 1$\mu$  
          - 1$\mu$ = 1 amu  
        - $\mathrm{e}^-$ mass = $\frac{1}{1836}$
- 1.2 Modern Atomic Theory
  - Fig 1.14 in textbook  
    - Electron cloud  
      - Much larger than the nucleus  
    - Nucleus  
  - Mass relationships of atoms  
    - Atomic number is the number of protons in each atom  
    - Most mass is in the nucleus because electrons are very light  
    - Mass number \= \#protons \+ \#neutrons  
  - Finding \# of neutrons in an atom \= mass number \- atomic number  
  - Isotopes have the same number of protons but different mass  
    - Figure 1-15  
    - Chemistry mostly depends on number of protons and electrons not neutrons  
      - Isotopes have similar chemistry and form the same compounds  
  - $^5_{11}B$ $^{80}_{199}Hg$
    - 5 protons 6 neutrons 5 electrons  
    - 80 protons 119 neutrons 80 electrons
